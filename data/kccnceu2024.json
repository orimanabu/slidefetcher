      "description": "No journey is ever really done, it only continues differently. CRI-O's journey in continuing its effort to be the best container runtime made specifically for Kubernetes is no different, even after graduating within the CNCF. In this talk, join the CRI-O developers as they walk you through the new frontiers of container runtimes: such as integration with WebAssembly (WASM), secured and simplified Podman-in-Kubernetes, and the present and future of Confidential Computing. This session will also cover initiatives CRI-O is following within SIG-Node, such as CRI stats and separate image file systems.This session caters to both newcomers and seasoned users, offering insights into CRI-O's new features and journey beyond.",
