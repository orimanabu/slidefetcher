OpenFeature, a CNCF incubating project, standardizes feature flagging, creating an open specification that provides a vendor-agnostic, community-driven API for feature flagging that works with commercial feature flag management tools or in-house solutions. In this session, we’ll discuss the static-context paradigm and its impact on client-side feature flagging.Feature flagging commonly leverages relevant contextual data to enable powerful targeting capabilities. In OpenFeature, we refer to this as the evaluation context. On the web or mobile, evaluation context typically remains constant for the duration of a user session; this is known as the static-context paradigm. It allows us to perform async operations early and cache the results. We’ll delve into this paradigm in detail, examining common architectures and the considerations to keep in mind when evaluating a feature management system.We’ll also explore OpenFeature’s API for setting evaluation context and recommend what should be included. We’ll discover how evaluation context can be used in practical situations, ranging from gradual rollouts to personalized experiences.Join us as we dive into the details behind the static-context paradigm.

      "description": "In this talk, we will take a lightning tour through the brand new experience in Crossplane that focuses on helping platform engineers build their own cloud native control plane from start to finish. We've listened to all the feedback from the community about how it can be challenging to get started with Crossplane, so in recent releases we've invested heavily into improving the developer experience and making it quicker and easier to successfully create a cloud native control plane and have it running reliably in production.  We will start the tour by showing off the new init command, through which you can rapidly initialise a new Crossplane Function, Provider, or Configuration project based on common templates. Using post-init hooks to continue the journey, we will customise our Function to start capturing the unique requirements of our control plane. We'll then start the local development cycle using the render command to execute our Function and get early development feedback and rapidly arrive at our desired functionality. We'll further verify the correctness of our control plane's behavior with the new validate command, which will point out any ways that our generated resources may differ from their expected specification. With our cloud native control plane verified in the local development loop, we deploy to a live production environment. But what if an elusive issue appears there that we can't quite pinpoint? This is where the new trace command shines to give you a tree-like graph of related resources in which you can easily identify and resolve the culprit! Finally, we will quickly show how you can observe the Crossplane health and resource usage using the new top command, further ensuring your production environment remains healthy and reliable.",

Kubernetes clusters are configured at creation time with an IP address range from which Services are assigned IP addresses, and is not possible to safely change this range afterwards. The current approach of using a single service CIDR can pose several challenges, including: IP address exhaustion, network conflicts issues, and limited flexibility. To address these challenges, Kubernetes version 1.29 brings a new feature, described on the KEP-1880, that allows Kubernetes to manage multiple service CIDRs. This would enable the creation of separate service CIDRs, addressing the limitations of the current single service CIDR approach.

      "description": "For Kubernetes containers on the same node, they may compete for crucial resources such as CPU, memory, network, disk, kernel parameters, GPU, and others. Although we are not defenseless: Kubernetes QoS , Quota and GC mechanism can restrict most potential problems. But for some other cases, pods may be able to break through container isolation walls (consciously or unconsciously), becoming disruptive neighbors, causing performance degradation, even node failures: examples: Pods eat up shared kernel resources( pid, fs.inotify), network resources(tcp_max_tw_buckets), overconsumption ..etc when goes to AI/LLM workloads, GPU contention is another main issue, as well as pod heavy stress on IO(gradient aggregation, checkpoint saving, dataset loading) This talk shares cases of resource-intensive pods and resource contention, then seek mitigation solutions, to minimize the impact of disruptive neighbors, enhance resource utilization, and prevent node failures.",

Back in 2018, the Linkerd project chose Rust for its data plane, betting that the language really would deliver the kind of speed and security that handling user data required. In 2021, they brought Rust to the control plane, betting that projects like kube-rs and kubert had matured enough that they could get the same kinds of wins in Kubernetes controllers. Join us for a whirlwind tour of how those bets have paid off for the service mesh, how great it is not to worry about null pointers and memory stomps, and why more and more projects are adopting Rust.",

In recent years, since Secure Software Supply Chain (and similar terms) entered the standard software development lexicon, it has become increasingly difficult for even subject matter experts to unpack all of the standards, tools, legislation, and more. This talk is designed to provide a lighthearted foundation for exploring and understanding the rapid-moving space of software supply chain security without using unfamiliar acronyms or expecting any expert knowledge. We will introduce principles and practices that can help to secure any software supply chain, regardless of size or infrastructure, and refer to open source projects and standards that can help achieve the principle in your own software supply chains. We’ll also introduce some common terms, so that you can bust them out in future discussions and impress your friends.",

      "description": "The SUNBURST attack (of SolarWinds) from 2020 has become the poster child for the software community as to what could go wrong. To meet new cybersecurity regulations, software producers are capturing metadata that shows the integrity of their supply chain. CNCF projects like in-toto / Witness capture machine-verifiable attestations about software supply chain operations. Frameworks like SLSA provide guidance on the type of attestations to generate. However, the real value of such attestations comes from verifying them against strict security policies that enforce a consumer’s expectations about the integrity of their software supply chain. In this talk, we walk through specific policies that can defend against high-profile supply chain attacks. We dive into the TAG-Security catalog of supply chain attacks like SUNBURST and describe how in-toto can be configured to reduce the likelihood of such attacks. We also contextualize this with SLSA specifications and US/EU regulations.",

      "description": "With the introduction of multi-stage builds in Docker, it is possible to separate build-time dependencies from run-time dependencies by starting with a fresh base image and copying only the necessary output of the build stage(s). This in turn helps create \"distroless\" images that don’t contain many convenience tools included in a distribution, such as a package manager. This makes it harder for a malicious actor to add additional software to a container, and also reduces the surface area for potential vulnerabilities that need to be kept up-to-date. However, many applications still rely on extra tooling, such as shells, to configure the runtime environment of the application to meet the needs of users. This talks demonstrates how using init containers allow us to separate the logic needed to configure a runtime environment from the environment itself, to get images that don’t contain shells or scripting capabilities, and provide a more secure container.",

At the same time, Kubernetes has emerged as the de facto technology for orchestrating workloads, and LLMs are no exception. In this talk, we will explore multiple strategies to reduce the footprint of these models in your cluster, making it possible to move them from the cloud to the edge. We will answer questions like how to select the right model, reduce their size, and optimize resource utilization by running them in a lightweight environment provided by WebAssembly.

      "description": "Many tools exist for debugging cloud-native applications, and they mostly take one of two approaches: they either continuously sync local files to the remote container, or they connect the local machine to the cluster. mirrord takes a novel approach: when developers run their code with mirrord, it injects a dynamic library into the process, hooks libc calls, and relays some operations to be executed on the cluster instead of locally. That way, developers can run their code locally and debug it with a debugger. With all of the code's input and output forwarded to and from the cluster, the local process “thinks” it’s running in the cluster and can be tested and debugged in cloud conditions. This talk will discuss the rationale behind using low-level techniques in cloud-native tooling, explain some of the low level Rust code that makes it possible, and show mirrord in action with a live demo.",

For example, Ingress and Gateway controllers are often deployed with read access to all Secrets in a cluster. What if we could introduce new authorization APIs that both mitigate future CVEs and enable entirely new reference patterns? In this talk, Rob and Mo will show how new APIs being developed by the community can help keep your clusters secure and safely enable cross-namespace references. Along the way, you’ll learn the history of these problems, including various stop-gap solutions that have been attempted along the way, to help you understand the context for the proposed changes. This session will provide you with clear guidelines for how to keep your clusters secure today by limiting unnecessary access to components running in your clusters. You’ll also learn how you can shape the future of these Kubernetes APIs by providing early feedback in the coming months of active development.",

Developers still write YAML by hand - or more often, compose files handed off to SRE for a YAML rewrite. An issue occurs in Kubernetes, and you're stabbing in the dark trying to access running object states to assess the problem. Why is working with K8s still so frustrating for developers? The answer: There isn't enough user experience (UX) focus on developers in K8s. K8s is more oriented towards ops and SREs than developers, developers find setting up a local environment difficult, and Kubernetes generally intimidates them. We engaged in a three-month long user research study of developers and the platform engineers who support them on their Kubernetes usage. We'll present our findings, and you'll gain insight into workflows and pain points of developers working with Kubernetes.

When running on Kubernetes, it lacks fault tolerance for internal shuffle data which is stored on workers' local disk. Spark will have high failure rate when running on unreliable cloud environment like shared cluster with heavy workload, or Spot Instance/VM which is prone to termination by cloud provider. To make Spark super reliable and leverage Spot Instance/VM to save cost, we built a new Shuffle Manager to store shuffle data replication on cloud storage. Spark will read shuffle data from workers in normal case, and read from cloud storage in case of worker failure. This greatly increases reliability without compromising performance. This talk will present how we built the Cloud Shuffle Manager and share the underlying optimizations we did to improve shuffle performance.

Although Kubernetes has its own E2E framework, it is baked into the Kubernetes source code, making it difficult to consume from other projects. For this reason, the Testing Special Interest Group built the e2e-framework, an out-of-tree Go framework to define end-to-end tests suites that can be used to test Kubernetes components. In this session we will talk about the e2e-framework and will explain how Datadog and Crossplane adopted it to test their own clusters and controllers.

Tekton has implemented features to address this, such as trusted resources, provenance, and Sigstore integration. However, users still don't have a secure way to share data that can preserve the chain of trust for artifacts from input materials to output products tracked in attestations. To address this issue, the Data Interface SIG is focused on providing first-class support for artifacts, adhering to critical standards like SLSA, in-toto, and CDEvents. This will be done while ensuring scalability for large enterprise environments and a user-friendly API. In this talk, we’ll discuss the SIG's approach to this problem, highlighting both successes and lessons learned. We'll present the design of the new artifact-related features and we'll share exciting news about the project roadmap. Join us to learn how to secure artifacts in Tekton and discuss ideas on how to further secure software supply chains.",

During this session, we will dive into KEDA, what it is and how it works. Then, we will cover our use case, using KEDA to perform event driven autoscaling down of resources. First, we will review our decision to use KEDA and the alternate options. Then, we will explore metrics exposure using Prometheus, and reading them with KEDA. We will then move on to the Keda setup and the main challenges we faced. Finally, we will evaluate the anticipated cost savings and compare it to the actual results.

DRA is a new approach for describing resource requirements in a Kubernetes cluster. It was first introduced in Kubernetes 1.26 and continues to remain in an alpha state in 1.29. It offers several advantages compared to existing approaches: Support for custom hardware can be added by developing and deploying DRA drivers, without having to modify Kubernetes. Resource parameters are defined by vendors. Sharing of a resource instance between containers and pods. In order to move forward to beta and beyond, we need feedback from the community to understand whether it’s ready in its current form, who wants to use it for what, and how we can solve some of the open challenges, like cluster autoscaler support.",

      "description": "This session will provide a unified approach to optimizing resource utilization via bin-packing pods and reducing costs in Kubernetes across AWS, GCP, and Azure. We will delve into the concept of bin-packing pods and its application in Kubernetes through the kube-scheduler's scoring policies. These policies prioritize nodes with higher utilization ratios for pod scheduling, enhancing cluster utilization and enabling the cluster autoscaler to remove underutilized nodes. We will explore the practical implementation of these strategies in different CSPs, demonstrating how to handle system utility workloads and over-provisioning for smoother scale-ups. We will also cover the current state of native support for bin-packing in managed k8s - EKS, GKE and AKS, providing insights into how to overcome these challenges. We will explore how, at ClickHouse Cloud, we saved millions of dollars on our Kubernetes infrastructure by employing a custom scheduler for efficient bin-packing of pods.",

      "description": "Spanning Kubernetes Clusters across multiple Availability Zones is common when optimizing for resiliency but introduces challenges like network performance and costs when workloads communicate with each other across AZs. AZs are designed for low roundtrip latency between different AZs in the same region, yet in a modern microservices application a single request can trigger multiple interactions crossing an AZ boundary over and over again, through several network layers including Application Load Balancers and Kubernetes proxies. This can create an aggregated effect which is usually hard to detect and troubleshoot on both latency and performance, but also cost since data transfer charges apply for cross-AZ communication. Enhanced Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) offers unparalleled visibility into the network stack of a Kubernetes cluster. It can be used to unravel concealed performance bottlenecks and understand the nuanced cost implications of network requests cross AZs in Kuberenetes.",

Though it has nothing to do with your problem domain, it’s still code that needs to be maintained, shipped, and tested. The good news is, a robust feature management solution combined with an observability platform can turn what was previously tech debt into an invaluable asset. Join us for an interactive session where we demonstrate the power of feature flags with OpenFeature.

Or forget to update an ObjectReference? Many real world usages defer to spinning up an apiserver with hundreds of CRDs installed as part of CI/CD just to test their manifests, since nothing else is reliable; others resort to incomplete and incorrect JSON schema validations. This is slow, expensive, and wastes valuable time.

The second law of Thermodynamics states that the Universe evolves spontaneously towards more chaotic states, eventually to “the Heat Death”.

This is also the case for the CNCF Landscape as a whole. With novel use cases in e.g. AI, cloud native will also need to evolve, increasing entropy. However, as we navigate these possibilities with Kubernetes at the base, it is critical that we talk about some of the philosophies and early decisions of the project, as well as how they have fared with an evolving industry. In doing so, we understand what we can rely on it for and what we can’t.

To address this challenge, Kinema adopts a proactive approach by combining real-time node resource-utilization data from the K8s API, vendor prices per node, and future node resource requirement forecasts. Following this, it uses an internal optimizer with the gathered data as input to calculate the optimal cluster configuration, including node choices and optimal pod placements. Finally, Kinema initiates and monitors a rescheduling iteration using the K8s scheduler to actualize the optimal configuration. This talk concludes with a demo of Kinema.",

      "description": "Digital agriculture (DA) broadly is the use of data-driven techniques toward the sustainable intensification of farm yields and efficiency, which can have major financial, environmental, and societal impacts. We present a cloud-native edge computing framework that allows agricultural decision-makers to make sustainable crop management choices in DA. This framework is powered by the KubeStellar open-source project that focuses on addressing configuration management challenges in multi-cluster environments, including edge. The proposed framework is designed with agricultural users in mind and allows researchers to rapidly deploy/manage computational AI models for plant disease detection using NASA imagery without retaining confidential stakeholder information. This system will empower agricultural stakeholders to make well-informed data-driving decisions by granting them access to accurate data on the farm and the latest advances in SI-ML disease detection in a cloud-native environment.",

Many operators claim to take care of these tasks. CNPG, StackGres, MOCO, others from Zalando or Percona... But do they meet expectations?

Datadog fully runs on Kubernetes and our infrastructure consists of millions of containers running across hundreds of clusters in different cloud providers. Most of our workloads are data-intensive and we need service to service communication to be as efficient as possible. When our workloads started spanning multiple clusters, we had to find solutions to discover services in other clusters, and to target deployments spanning multiple clusters. We will describe these challenges in detail and the different options we explored and their trade-offs. We will explain how we give pods native VPC IPs using Cilium and how we run a global DNS architecture relying on Kubernetes endpoints but independent of clusters.

The DRA (Dynamic Resource Allocation) approach currently developed by the community is promising but will require changes to Kubernetes scheduling mechanisms with the introduction of latency-inducing roundtrips between schedulers and DRA controllers. Moreover, GPU slices have to be requested by means of novel resource classes and claims, requiring users to adapt. This talk demonstrates how we exploit DRA today to enable just-in-time GPU slicing on large production Kubernetes clusters running a mix of small fractional and large distributed workloads. InstaSlice acts on queued AI workloads to slice GPUs with the help of DRA. By augmenting DRA with InstaSlice, we make it simple for users to leverage DRA with zero changes to queued workloads and zero changes to Kubernetes schedulers.",

Sometimes, resources are not set at all, while others are set once during initial testing but never updated. The Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) solves this problem by automatically configuring resources based on historical resource usage. On the other hand, changing resource allocation required Pod recreation since Kubernetes 1.27. This made VPA impractical for workloads where Pod restart is disruptive, resulting in leading to lower availability. With the introduction of the alpha in-place resource resizing, resources can now be updated without recreation, benefiting all workloads.

In this talk, I will describe the cloud-based infrastructure of Fink, relying on state-of-the-art distributed computing frameworks such as Apache Spark, and the integration with Kubernetes to enable real-time decisions. Finally, I will dive into the details of Fink's complex software stack which is rigorously tested in a self-hosted CI/CD environment on Kubernetes and OpenStack.

Linkerd, the graduated CNCF service mesh, has been using Rust for its data plane proxies since the release of Linkerd 2 in 2018: the data plane has to be as fast and secure as possible, so Rust was a natural choice. Most of the control plane was still written in Go, but that all changed with our first Rust controller in 2021.

We show how to embrace GitOps principles to effectively manage multiple control planes, eliminating the need for complex federation solutions. We’ll describe solutions for both north-south and east-west network traffic. We’ll also delve into scenarios where this approach is not optimal, such as highly stateful workloads. Benefits of the approach include cost-optimization, disaster recovery, and blue/green cluster upgrades. The approach has deep implications for the evolution of Kubernetes itself, and we’ll share how to think about future Kubernetes cluster management.",

They will look into how: - Knative Serving provides a simplified serverless experience - Knative Func provides a polyglot CLI tool for developers - OpenFunction orchestrates the functions lifecycle - OpenFunction integrates KEDA and Dapr to enable complex use cases.

We discuss caveats, emphasise the critical role of automation in scalability across diverse threat models, and live showcase one quantified attack tree utilising Tetragon.

Device drivers provide the foundational support for enabling such accelerators and this new class of applications. However, managing the lifecycle of device drivers at scale presents a unique set of challenges to cluster administrators. First, upgrading device drivers is a disruptive Day 2 operation that requires special care in order to minimize application downtime and prevent long running applications, e.g. batch training jobs, from losing their work. Second, it is oftentimes necessary to maintain multiple driver versions in the same cluster to support varying hardware configurations and application requirements. This talk will demonstrate an operator-based approach for tackling these challenges and making management of device drivers seamless in Kubernetes.",

This talk is about extending Kube, adapting its architecture to be a better fit for a world where instead of container orchestration two new personas are at the center: (a) the service \u0026 API provider (b) the self-service consumer, often developers or application owners. We focus on 3 dimensions to enable Kube to serve platform engineering better: - from kcp we take the workspace hiararchy as a vastly better multi-tenancy primitive. - cross-workspace API exports and bindings tailor-made for the service provider and consumer personas. - cluster mounting that integrates Kube clusters for a unified user interface and identity management.",

This session will cover the current state of the project including some of the new features that the community has completed such as adding support for Egress, FQDN, refined Tenancy Peer Expressions, Conformance Profiles and Policy Assistant tooling. We will also talk about our plans to move to GA, how you can get involved in the project and open the floor for a Q+A with the project maintainers! We welcome anyone interested in learning more about securing their cluster network.",

      "description": "A fundamental building block of highly available microservice architectures are availability zones. While it benefits the availability and resilience of microservices, it results in traffic crossing networking boundaries when communicating across zones. In managed clouds, crossing networking boundaries comes at a monetary cost. A significant portion of Spotify’s networking bill is the result of cross-zone traffic. Therefore, it has been an important business need for Spotify to reduce the amount of cross-zone traffic while maintaining the availability and resiliency of service communication. With gRPC, adopters can build their own load balancing algorithms and utilize technologies like ORCA to exchange advanced load balancing information between clients and servers. This talk will cover how Spotify uses gRPC to adapt their backend to backend load balancing to specific business needs: in particular reducing cross-zone traffic, while maintaining low latency and high availability.",

At Mercedes-Benz, we run more than 900 K8s clusters and over 6,500 machines. Given that our fleet is a fully managed solution, ensuring our clusters are hardened is imperative. To ensure a secure runtime for all apps, we previously relied on PSPs. In this talk we will delve into our journey of replacing PSPs. We will explore the reasons why PSS were not viable for our K8s fleet. We share our learnings on implementing Pod Security using popular tools like Kyverno and OPA and why we landed on VAPs. Our talk will cover the challenges we faced, the lessons we learned, and the advantages of a native solution over existing OSS tools.

We start by describing the attacks we've seen over the past year on a network of Docker and Kubernetes honeypots we've deployed publicly-facing on the internet, mimicking the Docker API, Kubernetes API server, and Kubelet API to catch what attackers are doing in the wild. Then, we review several high-profile container escape vulnerabilities and how they've been exploited in the wild. Based on this, we list the most common ways attackers attempt to deploy malicious workloads, backdoor a cluster, or escape containers—and what are the most effective and \"bang for your buck\" security mechanisms that you can implement in your own cluster.",

      "description": "Kubernetes offers static CPU/Memory specs to launch PODs. However, this also results in over-provisioning and low cluster utilization. According to the survey, the average CPU utilization of most K8s clusters is lower than 20%. After K8s support in-place resource resizing since 1.27, using dynamic resource specs based on actual usage becomes technically feasible. However, predicting PODs resource utilization accurately to make resources fully utilized is another challenge. In this session, we will share: * How Shopee uses different time series forecasting models for long-term and short-term predictions in scheduling and descheduling scenarios * What are the advantages and suitable scenarios of different models? * How we train and tune the models for K8s cases? * How we leverage the inference results for service persona to overcommit the resources significantly without affecting services' latency? This project helps us a lot in server cost savings. We hope our sharing can inspire you.",

Often times, the log processing tasks are handled by dedicated servers in the cluster with heavyweight software stacks (eg the JVM based ELK stack). With the advancement of lightweight sandboxes, such as Wasm, it is now feasible to have Wasm-based log processing applications, written in Rust or Go, directly embedded in the k8s pod. With WASI integration of eBPF, the sandboxed Wasm app can also manage eBPF agents on the host to collect and process kernel and network level logging data. In this talk, we will discuss the latest advances and tools for lightweight log processing. We will demonstrate a complete Wasm application to collect, filter, transform, and route log entries from a MySQL binlog to a Kafka queue. We will discuss how to add an eBPF agent to collect and filter networking data through the MySQL server socket to supplement the binlog data.",

How do you guarantee that all your containers are cached onboard before starting deployment? This talk will present a custom Kubernetes Operator whose goal is to make sure all containers are cached before letting Flux install the workloads.

In this presentation we will deep-dive into the Container Device Interface (CDI) as a new option for Device Plugin authors and the flexibility this unlocks including resource sharing for GPUs. Starting from use cases, we will take a look under the hood at how a Device Plugin exposes GPUs and different sharing options that can be used to improve device utilization and right-sizing to workloads presented, for example time slicing, MIG, and MPS.

This is the vision of composable systems. However, providers tend to implement in-house vendor-specific management APIs making integrations with platforms like Kubernetes increasingly more complex. Defining a common and usable method to manage composable resources is key. Ongoing initiatives like the Sunfish Management Framework — an open-source project from the OpenFabrics Alliance that provides a generic interface to query and manage fabric of composable resources — is an example of how the complexity of vendor-specific solutions can be abstracted. That said an additional integration step is required to bridge the gab between infrastructure management solutions like Sunfish and Kubernetes. In this talk we will describe the abstractions provided by Sunfish and we will present a Proof of Concept where we enable composable GPUs in Kubernetes.",

However, there is no mechanism to assign network identities to native processes running on hosts (e.g., kubelet) or processes in pods that use the host network. Securing host processes has traditionally been done using layer 7 auth, which comes with its overhead costs and scale challenges. In this talk, Vinay presents an innovative, industry-first approach that leverages eBPF to efficiently identify, in the kernel at network layer, traffic from native host processes and pods using host network. This takes network micro-segmentation to a new level. He will explain how host process identities are transmitted on a per-packet basis, and illustrate efficient network policy enforcement for such traffic. He will discuss how this approach offers significant scalability advantages, and conclude with a demo showcasing the proposed solution.",

Kubernetes can delegate operations on in-tree volumes to CSI drivers, however this perpetuates technical debt and carries several drawbacks: - In-tree volumes cannot use CSI-specific features like snapshots. - Clusters host 2 kinds of volumes with different capabilities. Leads to increased complexity. - Keeping those volumes around might not be future proof. At Datadog, we decided to homogenize our fleet and convert our thousands of in-tree volumes to CSI-native volumes. Since there isn't an official migration path, we crafted custom scripts and even patched the API server to achieve this with no downtime. Be ready to dive into volume handling internals. We'll share the details of our approach to the migration as well as the issues we faced. By the end of this talk, you will understand how to migrate your own in-tree volumes with minimal risk.",

The \"xray\" command output gives you a lot of information about the target image including what's inside. Let's build a TUI for SlimToolkit!

In this talk we’ll disprove all these rumors with demonstrations including: - Looping in eBPF - Leveraging maps for state - An eBPF implementation of a Turing machine equivalent This doesn’t mean eBPF is the right hammer for every nail; using the Cilium project as an example we’ll discuss why not every feature is implemented in the kernel.

In this talk, we will provide an overview of the Trimaran scheduler plugins and demonstrate their utility. Basically, Trimaran plugins are load-aware schedulers which place pods on nodes based on actual measured node resource utilization, while considering requests and limits specifications of resources. Having utilization as an objective helps (1) minimize power consumption by targeting an optimal range of utilization, (2) avoid congestion and interference among multiple containers running on the same node, and (3) lower the risk of over-commitment when containers burst their usage to the specified limits.",

      "description": "Misconfigurations are a serious security threat to Kubernetes clusters - services with overly permissive permissions can allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the cluster, steal data, or deploy malicious code. The risk increases when we talk about misconfigurations in built-in features of cloud vendors - these features are often trusted by users and are not typically inspected for any security misconfigurations. Sometimes a certain misconfiguration is not necessarily a security issue that can affect our protected cloud environment. However, chaining several misconfigurations can lead to the creation of a strong exploit chain. In this talk, Shaul will discuss about Kubernetes security blind spot, System Pods, and the security consequences of a misconfiguration in those pods. He will demonstrate a real case study of a dual privilege escalation chain that was found in default configurations of GKE that allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to Kubernetes clusters.",

APIs and plugins allow developers to add these key functionalities to LLMs and enable LLM applications. However, current LLM plugins are often built upon complex cloud native infrastructure designed for fully fledged services. The infrastructure is too heavyweight for plugins/serverless applications that mostly act as the lightweight links between LLMs and external services. Wasm has emerged as a compelling lightweight, portable, and secure runtime for this type of functions. In this talk, we will discuss how the open source community leveraged and built up the Wasm container infrastructure for LLM plugins. We will cover the major use cases and adoptions such as R\u0026D management, DevRel, marketing automation, and training/learning. Then we will dive into the technology stack, as well as the Rust SDKs the community has created, that enables these LLM use cases.",

      "description": "Knative enables users to execute workloads on demand, in K8s nodes. Deployments scale as needed, with application code packaged in container images. Ensuring optimal performance and isolation for workloads remains a crucial challenge for service providers. Low-level container runtimes like Kata and gVisor provide isolation for workloads by running containers inside a VM sandbox. However, the process of managing a full virtualization stack for workload execution results in increased usage costs, especially in the serverless paradigm due to the overhead of instantiating VMs. How can providers select the most suitable container runtime to optimize code execution in terms of cost, performance and isolation? In this presentation, we walk through the process of sandboxing Knative function pods. We compare existing sandboxed solutions to urunc, our custom container runtime that is able to spawn cloud-native unikernels. We share benchmark results and discuss the trade-offs of each solution.",

      "description": "The stateful nature of WebSockets carries inherent complexities regarding horizontal scaling. Kubernetes is a natural fit for stateless workloads, but operating scalable stateful applications can be challenging. We discuss these challenges in the context of an EV charging IoT platform. A concrete problem we faced revolves around WebSocket reconnection storms: if thousands of charging stations lose their connection, e.g., due to regional network carrier outages, they all try to reconnect simultaneously once the network issue is resolved, thus causing large load spikes. These load spikes propagate across our systems, potentially causing positive feedback loops and introducing instability. In this talk, we dive into the intricacies of scaling out WebSockets and how we evolved the system architecture towards event-driven communication. We discuss how introducing a Redis-based circuit-breaker component in the connection flow helped us alleviate bottlenecks and improve system stability.",

We will show how the optimal approach varies depending on the workload type, runtime behavior and the scale of the system. For instance, deep learning inference that needs the entire model to be on the node can be optimized differently than ML training workloads, which have a gradual data access pattern. We will also discuss the latency tradeoffs during the entire pod lifecycle, and the impact of the solutions we propose on network congestion, node storage utilization and reliability.

      "description": "Platform Engineers \u0026 SREs utilize metrics from Kubernetes clusters to evaluate platform health. However, being swamped with alerts for every metric often leads to alert fatigue. The worst consequence of alert fatigue is burnout or snoozing alerts, risking incidents. To tackle this at Intuit, we built Cluster Golden Signals \u0026 decreased MTTD. As a next phase, we explored integrating generative AI \u0026 LLMs with Cluster Golden Signals for enhanced platform debuggability and reduced MTTR. If the Golden Signal is bad, could we automatically initiate a check for deeper detection? Can generative AI predictably auto-remediate using its vast Kubernetes debugging knowledge? We explored k8sGPT \u0026 other tools for this. In this talk, we will delve into Intuit's development of Cluster Golden Signals \u0026 integration with generative AI for improved and faster platform debuggability. We will showcase demos to highlight the potential of using Cluster Golden Signals with generative AI.",

The plot airs this KubeCon delving from the tradeoffs of consuming software via distro vs. via projects to how I was fine-grained further as Kubernetes workloads.Exploring the rise of open-source software and projects like NPM, Maven, PyPI, the discussion centers on the dilemma of obtaining the latest software: opting for external installations for quick updates versus relying on more reliable distributions with robust supply chain checks for enhanced security. The presenters will dissect the techniques of choosing the consumer software by comparing various distributions like Alpine, Wolfi and how a few of them are solving for maintaining the pace with upstream projects. So join me, the Image, in this journey on how I am smoothly and securely rocketed into the cloud and become its native!",

In addition there are secure software factories, scorecards, best practices, and countless projects and concepts to keep track of. It seems even more intractable when you take into the velocity of cloud native. Don't worry! It's not actually that complicated. The panel of open source maintainers will discuss how the pieces to solve the supply chain security challenges are all there today. They will discuss straightforward approaches and simple security hygiene practices that can get you much of the way there, much of it in the CNCF like TUF, in-toto, or witness or in sibling organizations like OpenSSF with SLSA and GUAC.

Compare features of various service meshes and show how Sicredi used Cilium ClusterMesh to implement a full security policy across its infrastructure. Cilium is used as the CNI in Sicredi K8s clusters. Selecting it reduced operational and maintenance complexity. Cilium uses eBPF and avoids sidecars so has best performance vs competing service meshes. Its fine grain Cilium Network Policy made it possible to create rules access and operations rules per target application.

      "description": "The concept of the sidecar container has been a part of the Kubernetes landscape since 2015, but surprisingly, Kubernetes itself had no built-in concept of sidecars until Kubernetes 1.28. But what does this new feature actually provide? In this talk, we take a comprehensive look at sidecar containers as they stand today. We outline the long journey of the infamous KEP-753, which proposed a sidecar mode for containers in 2019 but took four long years to land, spawning countless memes along the way. We discuss how the new sidecar mode works and how it was designed; contrast it with what was available in the past; cover changes between Kubernetes 1.28 and 1.29; and outline some of the remaining wrinkles around sidecar containers that still remain in Kubernetes today. This talk takes a practical approach to the challenges and benefits of the sidecar model from the perspective of Linkerd and Kuma, two CNCF projects that make heavy use of sidecars today.",

      "description": "To accelerate the development of our Platform, Autodesk along with the partner organizations of the Cloud Native Operating Excellence group has developed a tool called IDPBuilder. With this all in one binary, we can now rapidly iterate on the K8s native capabilities that make up our internal developer platforms locally. In this session you will learn how IDPBuilder can stand up a CNOE reference architecture in minutes, with nothing other than Docker as a pre-dependency. You will also see how it makes creating and maintaining platform capabilities a breeze, as we have guaranteed API compatibility with our local, testing and production environments. Speaking of testing, IDPBuilder also powers our automated test suites that run as a part of our CI tooling. No more waiting for cloud environments to spin up. No more debugging brittle scripts that lack portability. IDPBuilder is a complete internal development portal and associated Kubernetes native capability platform in a box!",

Most of the tools are either very focused, like Kustomize, or very broad, like Helm. They are not always designed to work together, and sometimes you've had to write some batch scripts to stitch them together. Enter Carvel, a CNCF Sandbox project since September 2022. It tackles the application development lifecycle following the Unix philosophy: Carvel is a suite of seven single-purpose, composable tools, from yaml templating to a GitOps controller. They may be adopted individually to enhance your existing workflows, or combined for an end-to-end solution. In this session, with the help of a few slides and some live-coding, we will explore the Carvel portfolio by creating and deploying an application. After this talk, there is a very high chance you will want to try at least one of the tools!",

We'll shed some light on the questions you should ask about your SBOMs, who, and how you can achieve trust at each step of their lifecycle. We'll dip our toes into the why now, and how we can leverage OpenSource tools and specifications like in-toto attestations, Content Addressable Store, Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (\"salsa\"), or Sigstore to have SBOMs that are uniquely identifiable, unforgeable, complete, and available.

      "description": "Managed Kubernetes services offer the luxury of leveraging K8s without the burdens of control plane maintenance. But this convenience comes with compromises – notably, a reduction in control and, more critically, the introduction of CSP-specific cluster middleware that expands attack surface. This includes elements like DaemonSets, DNS services, and integral system processes in worker node images. Recently-issued CISA guidance on LotL techniques recognizes the problem and offers a solution directions, albeit in a general cloud and on-prem environments. In this talk, we demonstrate a series of LotL techniques that, in the absence of other methods, utilize middleware functionality to elevate RBAC privileges, move laterally, bypass security controls, evade detections, and cause a headache to security teams that often can't differentiate between legitimate component and malicious behavior. Examples include abusing fluent-bit for PI exfiltration; achieving cluster admin via an obscure system node-problem-detector host service; leveraging webhooks for persistency etc. We establish taxonomy, talk about the techniques in the context of CISA guidance, and map them onto the K8s threat matrix.",

      "description": "As software grows in size and complexity, rolling out new features in a highly distributed application, and understanding their impact, becomes an increasingly difficult task. OpenFeature and OpenTelemetry provide a set of vendor-agnostic and cloud-native APIs and SDKs for dynamic feature flag evaluation, and cloud-native observability. In this session, we walk through the process of instrumenting an application with OpenTelemetry, rolling out a new feature with OpenFeature, and leveraging OpenTelemetry for feature analytics. We will discuss the tradeoffs between traces, metrics, and the new events API, when each is appropriate, and how to make the same decision for your own application. We show that by using OpenTelemetry and OpenFeature together, you can easily understand the impact a feature has on your users' experience across cohorts, regions, and environments to make informed, data-driven decisions.",

Many well-established and upcoming Kubernetes features rely on secure namespace management, from in-cluster DNS resolution to Network Policies, Limit Ranges, Pod Security Standards, and Gateway API Cross-Namespace Routing. The talk will investigate the implications of compromise within a cluster if an adversary successfully tampers existing namespaces or crafts new ones by delving into real-world use cases, including multi-tenancy and cluster-native policy enforcement. A spectrum of mitigations and best practices to lock down namespaces effectively will be presented, covering strategies from Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to advanced object validation using admission controllers, including secure approaches with namespace templating in multi-tenant environments.",

With the introduction of projects like GUAC and Trustification, these can now be collected and analyzed successfully. Combining this information with policy engines, like OPA , we can create a policy that validates if a specific container or artifact is allowed to run in a cluster based on its security assessment. In this presentation, we will explain the concepts behind GUAC and Trustification projects. Next, we will demonstrate how OPA can be integrated with GUAC to create a policy that can answer the question: “Is the artifact allowed to be run in this environment?”.",

In this talk, we demonstrate monitoring containers’ memory usage in detail and discuss various swapping options. System-wide swapping has reached beta in Kubernetes 1.28. It takes action when a node's memory is running low. Container-specific swapping options allow, for instance, using memory only up to a certain limit and swapping out the rest regardless of the system memory situation.
