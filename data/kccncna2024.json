With the rise of AI technology, there's an increasing need to schedule AI workloads based on GPU/TPU resources. In this talk, we will demonstrate how to utilize the extensible placement scheduling mechanism and a GPU/TPU resource collector addon. Using an addon template, this setup can provide an AddonPlacementScore, facilitating placement decisions based on GPU/TPU resources.

It is common for pipelines to build and push images to the cluster, but uncommon for those images to be removed from a node’s local store once a CVE has been disclosed. Kubernetes has no built-in solution to this problem: its garbage collection only responds to disk pressure. As images become outdated, they present a risk as users may run a vulnerable container. Eraser, a CNCF sandbox project, is an open source solution that automates the scanning and removal of non-running images.What distinguishes Eraser is that it gives more control over removal: the developer decides what gets removed and when. By default, Eraser uses Trivy to scan images based on a given threshold of vulnerability. Images can also be removed based on custom logic, including support for using different scanners.The talk will begin with an overview of Eraser and discuss new features added to the project.",

While the Metrics API offers insights into CPU and memory usage at both the pod and node levels, it does not provide similar information for custom resources. Although resource requests for custom resources are specified in the pod spec, there is no visibility into how efficiently these resources are utilized at the node and cluster levels. To address this gap, we developed a Prometheus Node Resource Exporter tailored to monitor custom resources. Our case study focuses on evaluating the efficiency of Kubernetes schedulers when handling a high volume of AI/ML jobs, using GPU occupancy on the nodes as the primary indicator. In this lightning talk, we will present a comparative analysis of several scheduling frameworks based on the metrics collected by our custom exporter.",

      "description": "Kubernetes relies on API data being actively rewritten to support some maintenance activities related to at-rest storage. Two prominent examples are the versioned schema of stored resources (i.e., the preferred storage schema changing from v1 to v2 for a given resource) and encryption at rest (i.e., rewriting stale data based on a change in how the data should be encrypted). The simplest way to rewrite data is to issue no-op update requests via kubectl. This approach is problematic for any resource that can contain a large amount of data, such as Kubernetes secrets, and it is also impractical to perform without automation, as the number of resources that need migration is always growing. Storage Version Migration (SVM), which is now available as a built-in alpha API since Kubernetes v1.30, helps achieve this. However, the implementation of SVM has significant implications for the entire Kubernetes project and its ecosystem.",

There is a new component in the OTel contrib distribution, the Failover Connector.

AuthZEN, a new OpenID Foundation working group, was created in late 2023 to establish authorization standards. OIDF is the home of OpenID Connect, the ubiquitous standard for federated login, and that’s where we’re setting our sights. In this talk, I'll describe the current state of cloud-native authorization, including the policy-as-code and policy-as-data approaches, and the various open source projects in each camp. I'll also share the progress we’ve made creating a single authorization API that works across both policy-as-code (OPA, Topaz) and policy-as-data (Zanzibar-style projects), present the API specs we've created so far, and show off the various interoperable implementations. With this foundation in place, engineering teams can be more confident in externalizing their authorization and picking a provider without being locked in to a proprietary API.",

PVM (Pagetable Virtual Machine) is an experimental kernel technology that changes this by enabling KVM without hardware assistance or emulation. Using the research paper, this session will explain how PVM works and how the open-source Drafter and Firecracker projects can use it to migrate VMs between cloud providers. The session includes a live demo of running Kubernetes components like the Kubelet, CRI, CSI and CNI inside VMs and migrating them in a heterogeneous EC2, GCP, and Azure environment.

They’re serving end users, but currently, they have no idea what is going on. Are apps scaling correctly? Are automated deployments successful? What just went wrong, and how can it be fixed? Hero is desperate to escape this fog by adding CNCF tools for logs, metrics, traces, and dashboards. It is up to you, the audience, to guide our hero and help them grow from a lost and confused app to their final form⎯an app that knows their faults before their users do. In their fourth KubeCon ‘Choose Your Own Adventure’-style talk, Whitney and Viktor will present choices that an anthropomorphized app must make as they add observability to their cluster, enabling the ability to answer meaningful questions about their system. Throughout the presentation, the audience (YOU!) will vote to decide our hero's path! Can we navigate CNCF projects and add observability before the session time elapses?",

Over time, ApplicationSet has gained many features, becoming sophisticated and quite complex to use. In this session, we will dive into advanced ApplicationSet features: orchestrating complex rollouts of ingress controllers across multiple clusters and accommodating snowflake clusters. We will enable the audience to answer these and many other questions about using ApplicationSet. Finally, we will demonstrate an effective way to debug ApplicationSet specifications without digging through logs and altering production Argo CD settings.",

With traditional approaches, like tuning HPA thresholds, to scale in advance, we might pre scale even when not required due to outliers, which could be wasteful. At Intuit a novel deep learning forecasting model called N-HiTS was employed to solve this issue. This session will discuss and demo how we train N-HiTS, our most important model features, and how we deploy our service on a per-cluster basis to provide contextualized predictions for cost effective and on time auto-scaling.",

As encrypting traffic becomes the norm, so does the need for advanced methods to detect malicious activities hidden within encrypted traffic. This poster will focus on how eBPF can be utilized to gain early observability into incoming packets by capturing and analyzing metadata before packets are fully processed, and how eBPF offers a unique vantage point for identifying anomalies in real-time. It will discuss methods to detect abnormal patterns, the design of the eBPF programs used, and the integration of these programs into a broader monitoring framework. The insights from this research have the potential to significantly enhance network security by providing a scalable and efficient solution for monitoring network traffic without compromising privacy. Attendees will gain an understanding of the practical applications of eBPF in network security.",

In this talk, we explore why Envoy Proxy is the optimal choice for building an LLM gateway, leveraging its unique architecture and capabilities. Unlike traditional proxies (e.g. NGINX), which rely on scripting languages for customization, Envoy Proxy stands out due to its extensibility features: filter architecture, callout architecture (ext-proc, ext-auth), and ability to dynamically load libraries. Combined with its high-performant, async core ( C++), Envoy can run as an ingress, egress and mesh gateway. We'll look at using Envoy proxy for LLM credential management, prompt guarding/decorting, analyzing content safety, usage controls, context-aware failover, and observability.

Hybrid Kubernetes clusters are the perfect solutions to integrate these GPUs into existing services built on large cloud providers. At our startup focusing on cloud infrastructure, we have created numerous hybrid Kubernetes clusters based on K3s and P2P VPN using the Wireguard protocol. With this setup, we have successfully integrated more than ten sources of GPUs from different geographical locations, achieving nearly unlimited on-demand GPU resources while reducing GPU costs by 2x-4x. In this talk, we will discuss the architecture, pros and cons, requirements, and limitations of pure hybrid Kubernetes clusters for GPUs. We will also share lessons learned during the building and management of such true hybrid Kubernetes clusters.",

This talk will study GPU compute and memory requirements for LLM inference servers, like vLLM, revealing an analytical relationship between key configuration parameters and performance metrics such as throughput and latency. This novel understanding makes it possible to decide at deployment time an optimal GPU fraction based on the model's characteristics and estimated load.

One of the key reasons for adopting Kubernetes for our ML team emerged when we realized that we should serve all stakeholders across the JP/Politikens Hus organization, not just Ekstra Bladet. We then chose Kubernetes as our container infrastructure, which transformed the ML team into a dynamic ML ecosystem with great freedom under responsibility.Initially, we focused on building robust frameworks for training and deploying ML models as API services and model training. Today, our ML team operates at the forefront of innovation, where we embrace GitOps principles to streamline our machine learning platform. Through careful adoption of advanced techniques such as autoscaling, scheduling, event triggers, and dynamic service deployment, we ensure seamless integration of new ML models into our infrastructure.

Some projects have implemented optimization to address this. For instance, Cilium aggregates endpoint information into the CRD CiliumEndpointSlice before distributing it to its daemonset. However, many projects have not yet adopted such data aggregation optimizations and Currently, there is still no project to help improve the communication between all components and the Api-server. ClusterPedia supports to launch per-node Api-server proxies to serve all local pods, and utilize eBPF to resolve the API server's clusterIP to the local proxy, which transparently implements API server access redirection on demand.

Traditionally, managing resource requests and limits in Kubernetes has focused on individual containers within a pod. While this approach offers granular control, it can become cumbersome and error-prone, particularly for complex applications with multiple containers. Join us as we'll examine the challenges and scalability limitations posed by container resource micromanagement resource allocation. To address this issue, the pod-level feature specification is introduced. In this session, we'll delve into the transition towards pod-level resource specifications, providing an intuitive method for defining resource requests and limits at the pod level, in conjunction with the existing container-level settings. This innovative approach offers enhanced flexibility and optimized resource utilization for a variety of workloads, including those with init containers and sidecars.",

Moreover, it did so by leveraging a number of CNCF technologies, including Kubernetes, Istio, etc. We’ll share the potential of these technologies, as well as their limitations, by explaining how they were used to build a scalable, reliable, and secure cloud platform. We’ll discuss how to implement cloud tenancy concepts, enforce isolation among tenants, and how we built a cloud API leveraging k8s API machinery and service mesh. A key innovation in building the private cloud platform was the “Kubernetes Defined Networking” (KDN) stack we created: by leveraging existing k8s networking features (e.g. load balancer, etc.) along with a few key enhancements, we implemented most of the traditional cloud SDN concepts, like VPC, firewall, VM support, etc.",

While service dependencies are often difficult to track, the rise of zero instrumentation Observability tools has eased access to this data, providing a potential baseline for AuthZ rules. Projects such as CNCF Pixie and Hubble expose language agnostic protocol traces providing full visibility of their environments.

What if we could restrict the component's ability to write resources only to those belonging to the node it is running on to prevent such escalation attacks? In this talk, Anish and James will introduce new Kubernetes security enhancements to bound service account tokens, which can be used with validating admission policies to enforce per-node restrictions on service accounts.

The backend components of these scaling applications are a sticking point for R\u0026D organizations and a major reason applications aren't as agile as they otherwise could be. When applications scale, data systems undergo a lot of change proportionally. For example, table and index scans travel further, index creation re-organizes more data, backups and restores get slower, data integrity loosens, changefeeds get thicker, and staff spreads thinner. The system that scales best is the one in which these dimensions are impacted the least.",

These failures cause resource underutilization, wasted engineering time, and high operational costs, often requiring users to resubmit jobs. Current AI/ML frameworks lack adequate fault tolerance strategies, typically requiring manual intervention and causing delays before jobs can resume. This talk explores fault tolerance strategies including naive job restarts on failure, job restarts with hot spares, and job restarts by replacing faulty nodes. We discuss how to achieve fault propagation by leveraging node and pod conditions and address gaps in fault discovery and error propagation in the existing Kubernetes ecosystem. Our talk will also include ways to enhance components like the node-problem-detector and introduce new elements to close the gaps in fault detection , propagation reaction and remediation.",

However, there are ways to make these transitions safe, incremental, low-stress. In this talk we'll walk through a real-world case study of switching a production system from one database to another with no downtime, and no tears, using techniques like Expand/Contract, Dark Launch and Parallel Run. We'll also see hands-on examples of using CNCF open standards like Open Feature and Open Telemetry to manage this migration.",

This task usually falls to platform or cloud engineering teams, but they often feel abandoned by their security counterparts, uncertain of which requirements will deliver real security value. While published benchmarks and security guides for Kubernetes are helpful, not all recommendations work for every use-case. They may require Kubernetes alpha or beta features which could cause issues with platform stability. Our desire to prioritize “perfect” security over having a functional platform that addresses relevant risks can leave us with nothing, frustrating everyone. Kubernetes is meant to increase application delivery velocity, but when overly strict compliance prevents a team from moving forward, they will subvert security requirements. Let’s stop obsessing over the red in our security and compliance dashboards and focus on what adds real value by reducing risk.",

In this talk, we introduce K-Foundry, an open-source custom controller for KCP that translates Kubernetes jobs to Slurm jobs and exposes Slurm nodes and cluster info as Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). This integration combines Slurm’s robust job scheduling with Kubernetes' dynamic orchestration and API-driven ecosystem, easing the administration of both clusters through a common API.

However, the inference process for these models presents significant challenges. LLMs are computationally intensive, often requiring specialized hardware like TPUs or GPUs to achieve reasonable response times. In some cases their substantial size can strain the resources of a single machine. Specifically, models such as Gemini, Claude, and GPT4 are too large to fit on any single GPU or TPU device, let alone on any single multi-accelerator machine, necessitating what we refer to as multi-node server deployment where a single model server “backend” runs as a distributed process on multiple nodes to harness enough accelerator memory to fit and run the model. This talk presents LeaderWorkerSet, a new k8s API that enables multi-node model inference. We demonstrate its capabilities by orchestrating state of the art model servers such as vLLM and JetStream on both GPUs and TPUs.",
