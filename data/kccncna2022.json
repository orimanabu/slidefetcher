A software operator encapsulates the knowledge and expertise of a real-world operations team and codifies it into a dedicated piece of software. Software operators help human operators and administrators run their applications efficiently and effectively. Canonical provides an OSS-based platform and framework for building and running operators.And what better place to talk about operators than KubeCon, the Cloud-Native Foundation’s flagship conference? Canonical has been hosting Operator Day at Kubecon since 2020. The fourth edition of Operator Day took place at Kubecon Europe earlier this year. We hosted various sessions about the basics behind operators, what they are, how to use them, how to create them and how your team can benefit from them. Speakers shared knowledge and insights about their software operator journey, from configuration management to application management.

Co-located with KubeCon, Chaos Day is a one-day conference that explores this transformational technology and its impact on the future of cloud native DevOps. By making chaos engineering cloud native, a new generation of reliable systems has enabled developers to focus on innovation rather than the distractions of system failures. No longer is it necessary to face the uncertainty of complex systems and failure; now, it’s possible to test and proactively improve without compromising reliability. The highly complex nature of orchestrated container environments, like Kubernetes, creates stress and pressure on developers to understand the new failure modes they need to consider when adopting this technology. Leveraging Chaos Engineering allows for greater reliability and understandability of complex systems for the developer. This conference will explore both Harness Chaos Engineering and the use of LitmusChaos (CNCF incubating project) to improve reliability of cloud native deployments. Here’s what Harness and the ChaosNative team that founded the LitmusChaos project will present:Overview of Chaos Engineering and how it accelerates cloud native adoption and transforms reliabilityHow to adopt Chaos Engineering in CI and CD systems to achieve shift left reliabilityHow to leverage Chaos Engineering in production environmentsLearn how to scale the practice of Chaos Engineering using GitOpsHands on workshop for how to run your own Chaos Day to level up your organizationPresentations from the Litmus Community on how the CNCF LitmusChaos project is playing an instrumental role in their reliability strategy and journeyState of Chaos Engineering adoption in the cloud native industry and the emergence of Chaos Maturity Model Click here to register for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon and add this workshop/event to your registration.If you are already registered for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon, please modify your registration to add-on this workshop/event.For questions regarding this event, please contact: events@harness.io",

If you are, come and spend a morning with best-selling author and global video-trainer Nigel Poulton as he unpacks the architecture of Kubernetes and walks you through deploying an application.The workshop starts out with the basics so that everyone’s on the same level. It demystifies things like, “What is a cloud-native microservices app”, and what do we mean when we say things like “Kubernetes is a cluster” and “Kubernetes is an application orchestrator”...Once the groundwork is laid, the workshop explains the architecture of Kubernetes and introduces important Kubernetes primitives such as Pods, Services, and Deployments. Throughout the workshop, every new concept will be clearly explained.There’s also lots of hands-on examples. You’ll deploy a simple app, demonstrate some of the self-healing capabilities of Kubernetes, scale the application up and down, connect to it from the internet, perform a zero-downtime rolling update, and perform a versioned rollback. By the end of the morning, you’ll know exactly what Kubernetes is, you’ll have deployed your first Kubernetes application, and you’ll be ready to maximize the rest of your KubeCon experience!

      "description": "Service proxies are becoming increasingly complex data parsers. Out of the box, Envoy supports HTTP protocol translation, payload decompression, gRPC-JSON transcoding, and many other features that operate directly on raw request bytes. Coupled with the deployment of Envoy as a \"front\" edge proxy, these parser-like features become an attack surface for external clients — a malicious HTTP request may trigger undefined behavior, resulting in service mesh downtime. Envoy developers use coverage-guided fuzz tests to automatically discover parser bugs. When run with C++ sanitizers, fuzz tests capture intricate corner cases a developer may have missed. Integration with OSS Fuzz provides continuous fuzz testing and vulnerability reports, allowing developers to fix such bugs before the features are released. Join this talk for a case study on Envoy's multi-year adoption of fuzz testing. Learn about how we harden Envoy for production deployments and the surprising bugs our fuzz tests discovered!",

      "description": "Kubernetes is one of the largest and most well known systems written in the Go programming language. Kubernetes is also a fairly complex codebase, which often pushes Go to its limits. To make it work, we sometimes have had to go outside of the \"normal\" usage of Go's tooling and ecosystem. Anyone familiar with the project will probably groan when they heard phrases like \"staging repo\" or \"code generator\". We have accrued a pretty significant amount of technical debt over the last few years. With Go 1.18 comes a powerful new feature - \"workspaces\". This is what happens when the language team looks at what their users are doing and as asks \"how can we make this better?\". We can wipe away a lot of that debt - \"just use workspaces\". But, sadly, it's not as easy as it might sound. This talk will introduce listeners to the problems we have, the gross workarounds we use, and how workspaces make it all better. We'll talk a bit about the work that is being done to make \"just use workspaces\" a reality.",

I also highlight how one could request feedback, make lasting connections, what it means to contribute and how anyone could make a meaningful impact.

Officially launched at KubeCon NA 2021, the Cloud Native Glossary (glossary.cncf.io) aims at explaining complex technical terms in simple words. As cloud native becomes more mainstream, increasingly more people seek to understand what these technologies, approaches, and concepts mean. Whether searching for a service mesh definition or trying to understand what CI/CD is, we need a trusted source with definitions anyone can understand — even without a computer science degree. But even if explained in simple terms, English definitions can still be hard to grasp for non-native speakers. To address this, nine teams set out to localize the Glossary in their native languages. With seven languages partially live and two more coming soon, there is still a lot of work ahead. Join this session to learn where to find it, and how to use and contribute to it.",

      "description": "The social structure of an Open Source project can be quite complex, and as the project grows it only becomes more complex over time. Understanding the reason members are joining your community, and why members choose to stick around is key to having the exponential growth your project deserves. Let's take some time to dive into some of the basic ways to start gathering the right metrics. To start how do you define a community member? With this definition, we can pinpoint the minimum requirements to be a community member and start to track this as part of the onboarding flow. As we follow the community journey, the next thing we want to measure is engagement. How has this user interacted with the other members and have they utilized any community resources? Do we know which of these activities result in the highest likelihood of them contributing in a meaningful way? You can probably tell by now, that just by having the right data you can start to nudge members on their way to being your community superstars, and catch some users before they fall out of the community funnel altogether. So join this talk to learn what is going on with your community and how you can make it even better.",

Common IP management hurdles with Kubernetes clusters include IP assignments when building a cluster and challenges faced when deploying in a multi-faceted environment.

In this talk, Cynthia will discuss new and existing KEPs that SIG-network has implemented to help mitigate IP challenges. Such features include discontiguous cluster CIDRs and the journey to IPv6.

      "description": "Everybody either knows what Kubernetes is or has heard it. It’s a critical component to scalable, high availability and distributed design of most cloud based productions systems. Why would I bother understanding how it behaves outside the cloud provider I commonly use? Well, that was the case of this project, which aimed to build an IoT system that handles Terabytes of data, entirely on-prem due to business needs. As expected, things were not behaving the same as in the cloud provider: lots of kube-api errors, missed heartbeats, database operators started rolling restarting deployments because of it; but the main reason was well hidden from the sight: etcd performance was not great on prem. etcd has an extremely and sustained high performance that is based on two factors: latency and throughput. But in this on-prem environment, latency was affected by the hardware’s initial design. How do you measure etcd performance? Benchmarks to the rescue! Learn about this experience, what is benchmark, what is latency, what is throughput and how to effectively measure etcd performance through benchmarks to correctly test your infrastructure when a brand new kubernetes cluster is created, particularly on-prem, and take advantage of the full potential of the Kubernetes environment.",

      "description": "Data scientist and container enthusiast Ayse Kaya and her team at Slim.AI analyzed more than 100 of the world’s most popular public container images using open source tools to better understand what developers encounter when running containers in Kubernetes. What they found was a vast, varied, and complex world that gives developers massive opportunities to scale, but also presents risks to both security and productivity. This talk shares the data, visualizations, and insights they generated from their research. Kaya shows the current paradox in software supply chain practices (i.e. taking advantage of abstraction vs. knowing what’s in the software you ship), and that even small, special purpose containers could have thousands of packages, libraries, and licenses, not to mention critical vulnerabilities. Finally, she’ll highlight the current trade-offs teams make between “developer experience” and “production readiness”, and open a discussion about how we can improve as an industry.",

We strive to enhance our Developer Experience by accelerating their velocity and self-serve maturity, while abstracting away the complexities of the underlying Kubernetes platform. But, with so many CNCF Application Definition solutions and projects available, we were faced with the “Paradox of Choice”! Choosing the right toolset for our application abstraction was challenging, as the toolset had to satisfy our wide array of use cases as well as fit our existing toolchain. Come hear us talk about how we evaluated some of the powerful open source projects in this space, including but not limited to client-side solutions (Kustomize and Helm) and server-side solutions (KubeVela and Crossplane). We will talk about our proof of concept across these projects that helped us make data driven decisions, our deciding factors and our competitive analysis of these projects.

We’ll walk through how we leveraged tools like gRPC, Kubernetes, LevelDB, and Prometheus to implement two new open source projects that serve as the heart of our system. We’ll also confess all the ways we messed up during the process — from struggling to debug protocol buffer errors, to tangling up send and receive goroutines, to reasoning about the phases of replication. It won’t all be pretty, but we hope you’ll benefit from the lessons we learned, including the most important lesson — that you *can* build your own distributed system. We’ll close out by talking about why rolling our own system (in spite of all the headaches and mistakes) made sense for our use case, and why it might also make sense for you. Attendees will walk away with a hearty introduction to distributed systems concepts, as well as a to-do list of things they can investigate in their own systems to determine how they might be able to reduce concurrency-related bugs and/or consistency-related costs, improve maintenance, and reach more daily active users around the world.",

However, creating SBOMs is challenging. To be effective, SBOMs must be as accurate and complete as possible, but at the same time be usable. Today, Software Composition Analysis (SCA) based SBOM generation tools strike a great balance in this regard. There are several great SCA-based SBOM generator tools today, but all of them have blind spots, such as finding an executable file that has no metadata associated with it. What if there was a way for SBOM tools to reliably fill in these gaps in order to produce a more complete SBOM? Enter the SBOM X-ray vision! In this talk, we demonstrate a novel way to peek into these opaque files through SBOM discovery and look-up. Through the use of the Rekor transparency log and In-toto attestations, we’ll show how easy it is for existing projects to share SBOM information with other projects using native CI integrations.

In order to better use and manage kubernetes to meet practical needs of today’s increasingly diverse workloads in large production clusters with complex configurations, it’s essential to understand how kube-scheduler works, what features are available, and how to properly configure and manage them. This tutorial will review the basics of kube-scheduler, including kube-scheduler basic features, scheduling framework, scheduler plugins and profiles, how to configure kube-scheduler with different parameters, plugins and multiple profiles, and how to test and evaluate kube-scheduler on a local machine and in a cluster. The tutorial will present the latest scheduling features and how to use them. Advanced topics such as bin-packing, scheduling scalability, batch support, and how to extend the default kube-scheduler with custom scheduler plugins will be introduced too. The tutorial includes demos and hands-on sessions and is suited for kubernetes administers, users and developers, from beginning to advanced levels. The audience is expected to come prepared with a personal laptop with kubernetes, e.g., Minikube, installed.",

      "description": "Cloud-native community has long desired the ability to resize pods in-place because pod restarts are expensive for long-running applications and disruptive to services. To resize pods, we commonly rely on Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) to observe usage, recommend, and reactively enact resource updates.An alternative approach is to resize pods based on deterministic events. For example, you can capture events with eBPF to detect when a CPU-intensive command is going to be executed, and proactively resize the pod CPU accordingly. In this talk, Pablo will show an interesting use case where remote development environments run inside pods. These pods need minimal resources when a developer is writing code, but need significantly higher CPU \u0026 memory when a developer issues a “build” command or runs a battery of tests. In-place resize is mandatory in this scenario, otherwise, the development experience would be broken on every pod restart.Vinay will then talk about the current in-place pod resize feature design, which is soon landing as alpha in Kubernetes. He will go over the CRI changes, discuss the design rationale \u0026 trade-offs. He will then lay out the next steps and discuss what the community can do to help to drive this feature to a rock-solid GA over the next year.",

With the proliferation of infrastructure as code, many of the same threats posed to software supply chains are also threats to our IaC ecosystems. IaC provides clear advantages to platform teams, bringing uniformity and productivity to developers, but with the great power bestowed to it, it also presents a juicy target for supply chain attacks, often while no one is looking. It's only a matter of time before our Site Reliability Engineers will need to defend against the same attack vectors as their Software Engineer counterparts. How can DevSecOps practitioners learn from the patterns and practices being developed by projects like SLSA? Can IaC pipelines build on tooling like Sigstore and in-toto? This talk covers the application of software supply chain security principles to modern IaC pipelines. Jesse and Jason discuss design changes to the Crossplane package management system and it’s forthcoming integration with Sigstore, enabling IaC provenance and attestations. Finally, a demo showcasing the equivalent of “admission control” for IaC will provide inspiration for further work on Secure IaC Supply Chains.",

K8s-flavored, yes, but also similar to other communities such as OpenInfra, Drupal, and the Linux distributions. In this one-act play with two practitioners, Jen breaks down successful community caretaking and stewardship through the way we run events such as KubeCon, and Karsten offers a live diff, comparing and contrasting the Jen's experience with his own and what is gathered in the Open Source Way guidebook for community management practices.

Extensive growth with over 300 internal projects so far and more than 2000 internal users proofs advanced analytics i.e. ML, AI, NLP capabilities should become easily consumable not only by specialized, dedicated teams, but make them close to subject matter experts. In this session we would like to shed more light on how a specialized cloud native Kubernetes scheduler (Volcano) enables us to deliver multi-tenant large scale processing capabilities. The optimal resource usage with stability of core services are key for our cloud native platform. To enable dynamic allocation and hdrf (hierarchical dominant resource fairness) we have created an extension to Apache Spark binaries. This allows users to use Volcano with Spark interactive mode in a Jupyter notebook. Additionally we have created interfaces to visualize all the scheduling metrics like the yarn ui.",

We deep-dive into a stand-alone buildpack builder (pack) and a Kubernetes native buildpack service (kpack), detailing how both use the lifecycle component to build source applications into images.Having established a deeper understanding of how a platform works, we workshop approaches to supporting multi-architecture builds. It is increasingly common for developers to require their application to run on both x86_64 and ARM64. The current platform specification maps a platform onto a single architecture and implementations build x86_64 images on x86_64 build platforms and ARM64 images on ARM64 platforms. We ask how applications can be built on x86_64 and produce images for both x86_64 and ARM64? Are the necessary changes to the platform and Buildpacks APIs backward compatible?

These applications enable us to design and develop scalable, distributed, and flexible systems. Kubernetes brings flexibility and a distributed platform, but it doesn't provide any built-in way to deal with event-driven scaling properly and in real time. KEDA is one of the fastest growing CNCF projects that solved these needs. Scaling based on CPU and/or memory usage doesn’t fit well with event-driven processes. Current autoscaling solutions are usually complex, and their scope is too attached to a specific provider. KEDA provides a simple way to gather the metrics from external sources (such as queues, streams, databases) and translates them into Kubernetes metrics to drive event-driven autoscaling. During this session, two of the current KEDA maintainers and creators will introduce KEDA: what it is, how it works (with demos), and discuss future development plans.",

      "description": "Kubernetes has several security mechanisms that can be used to secure your applications: - limit network connectivity with network policies - block some system calls with seccomp profiles - restrict access to some Linux capabilities in security contexts Defining those policies is difficult. It usually happens that the team defining them is not the one that created the application, hence they might not have a good enough view of the architecture to know how to write them. We will present and demo different ways to automatically generate the 3 different kind of policies mentioned above by monitoring the application's events with the following eBPF-based tools: - Inspektor Gadget - Kubernetes Security Profiles Operator - oci-seccomp-bpf-hook We'll discuss the limitations of this approach and the future ahead of these tools. Finally, we will explain how applications can be audited to see if the security policies are respected.",

Its pluggable architecture via providers is vendor agnostic and makes its adoption across various infrastructure environments (public clouds, on-premises) easy and gives its users the flexibility of using a variety of infrastructures with the same set of tools and workflows. Writing a provider follows a de-facto pattern (there are \u003e20 providers created following this pattern). The talk “Building Your Own Cluster API Provider the easy way” at KubeCon EU 2022 was well received with 600+ registering (and more than that attending), and many indicating they are at various levels in their provider journey. While the talk touched upon high-level constructs of writing a provider, there is a lot of functionality to be covered in order to make the provider usable or to reach the first release milestone. This tutorial aims to be an in-depth hands-on exercise where the audience can get to a fully CAPI conformant provider starting from scratch.Everything can be done from your laptop.

Being a new contributor to open source can be intimidating because you don’t know exactly what is helpful and what could hurt the community and frustrated maintainers. While a part of this gap can be attributed to the choose-your-own-adventure nature inherent to open source, there's already tons of material on how to get started technically. What nobody actually shines light on is the cultural dynamics. With this talk, the speakers aim to retell their experience and list common pitfalls almost everyone (including the speakers!) have made. This isn’t just about the right way to make a PR. The hardest, and most rewarding part, of any community is the people. The audience will learn how to engage in open source to ensure that the community they join will continue to be happy and healthy.",

What happens because SIGs operate as silos? This talk is a case study in a recent cross-sig bug where a subtle behavior change by one SIG led to an outage causing bug in another.

What if you had to build dozens of controllers managing thousands of resources? You'd need a factory to produce full controller implementations from API model schemas. Amine and Jay happen to work in such a Kubernetes controller factory! In this talk, they will give you a tour of the Kubernetes controller factory, showing you how to use the API machinery and what dangers linger on the factory floor. They will teach you how to be the most productive worker in the whole factory by building on top of controller-tools and kubebuilder functionality.

      "description": "Setting the proper limits and requests to a Kubernetes cluster is one of the most challenging tasks engineers have to face. Not doing this could have critical consequences, like outages or astronomical cloud bills. Sometimes, when engineers don't have the full picture of the cluster they're working on, they tend to use more resources than actually needed for their workloads. This is called the \"greedy developer\" problem. To avoid this, you'll have not only to identify the unused resources, containers without limits, or very tight ones. But also to set the right requests and limits. In this talk, Jesus and David will walk you through this process. You might have to add new nodes, or just resize your workloads. Since every cluster is different, also measure the optimizations made, to help our audience with their own clusters.",

      "description": "Deploying, monitoring, and managing complex applications across multiple clusters is a challenging task. A complex application is usually composed of multiple microservices that need to be deployed to different clusters based on the criteria like latency, bandwidth, local context, etc. Some microservices need to be replicated in multiple geo-locations. Some microservices have cross-cluster dependencies. Some of these microservices deployed across different clusters may also need to communicate with each other securely. Furthermore, various infrastructure-related configurations need to be done in order for some microservices to function properly. To reduce the operational cost of deploying and managing these complex applications, automation is a must, and the goal is to achieve zero-touch deployments. In this talk, we'll examine the landscape of available solutions such as Kubedge, ArgoCD, Karmada, EMCO, etc. and provide an in-depth analysis of each of them.",

The report also shows that PR reviews were down -24% across the k8s repo. The existing contributors are burnt out and have started to move away from the project. This is affecting the sustainability, quality and velocity of the project, with major regression-related backports in recent releases. It clearly shows that most companies profit from k8s but don’t contribute back. Continuing this model is a huge risk to the whole CNCF ecosystem. We will show strategies on how employers can practice “Business Aligned Open Source”. We will cover how to: - Add value to internal products, improve speed to market and innovation - Build expertise and better support customers - Have employees dedicate a certain percentage to upstream - Incentivize career growth - Surface areas of risk that require investment - Establish company’s influence and credibility in the community [1] https://www.cncf.io/reports/kubernetes-annual-report-2021/",

Beyond the basics, HostProcess containers also open the door to more effective logging, monitoring and debugging of the Windows environment.   In this session, we will cover the basics of using HostProcess containers and see how they differ from other Windows containers. After gaining an understanding of these differences, we will explore three examples covering the common use cases for HostProcess containers: CNIs, debugging, and on-demand monitoring. The attendees will see concrete examples of HostProcess Containers, novel approaches to debugging, and gain inspiration for new ways of interacting with Windows enabled clusters.",

To help facilitate this transition, we will cover auto instrumentation of an application using an OpenTelemetry client and we will cover multiple best practices to build a scalable trace pipeline to deliver this data to a Jaeger backend. Moving Jaeger from a tracing system to a monitoring system has been the big push for the project in the last year. Made possible by OpenTelemetry and the processor layer which allows for the creation of metrics derived from traces in the pipeline. Operational monitoring is now possible using the new monitoring tab, which adds metrics capabilities to Jaeger UI via another graduated project, Prometheus.

However, we see a common trend in the CNCF ecosystem to provide specific features in an API-driven fashion to the internal teams. This includes the Prometheus-based monitoring and observability functionalities. Prometheus is a de facto standard for monitoring static and cloud-native workloads, but similar to Google Borgmon it's built on self-hosting premises. Given the data required for reliable monitoring, analysis, and observability, and its multi-tenant, multi-cluster aspect, creating a single observability team focused on providing tooling to others is very common. Running it as a service is a natural step. In this talk, Ben from AWS and Bartek from Red Hat will introduce you to the Thanos project that brings Prometheus API and storage to a scalable, multi-cluster, multi-tenant level.

So, how does a cloud or infrastructure team provide the necessary guardrails to ensure that the Kubernetes environments created by developers are compliant with the organization’s security, governance, and cost management standards? In this talk, Dolis shares an approach where Crossplane and Kyverno, both CNCF projects, can be used to provide self-service Kubernetes environments on the cloud for developers with necessary checks and restrictions in place. While Crossplane, an increasingly popular IaC orchestrator running using Kubernetes, is used to provision different infrastructure resources, Kyverno can be utilized to provide governance on what type of resources can be created, by whom, and how the resources are configured. We can automate resource provisioning with governance using Crossplane and Kyverno. In addition to deploying and managing cloud resources, you can also create Kyerno policies to ensure that the generated resources are compliant with your company’s requirements.",

Since VMs are typically stateful and not as homogeneous as containerized applications, additional care must be given to ensure that VM state is properly initialized, managed, and protected. We will explore how the KubeVirt storage layer bridges the gap between QEMU/KVM Virtual Machines and K8s storage primitives to provide a feature-rich API that manages data for the entire lifecycle of a VM. We will discuss how new VMs can be created with pre-populated disks based on “golden images” and how running Virtual Machines can be safely snapshotted/restored. Disaster Recovery workflows are enabled by the VirtualMachineExport API as well as integration with Velero. Future initiatives, such as Volume Populator support will also be discussed. You will come away with enough of a high level understanding of the KubeVirt storage APIs and architecture to make meaningful contributions.",

      "description": "In order to ensure the trustworthiness of your software supply chain, maintainers must restate a number of assumptions. As opposed to inherently trusting build systems to serve accurate package metadata, we propose verification of every claim in the chain against the actors and tasks involved in the process. The combination of cryptographically verifiable identities with the use of transparency logs provides a novel approach to accomplish so and increase the security guarantees of your release artifacts.Project Sigstore provides a toolkit to allow organizations to publish verifiable provenance about publicly distributed artifacts. This metadata is in turn stored on the Sigstore Binary Transparency Log (Rekor), signed and verified by use of Keyless Signatures (Cosign) and the Sigstore Certificate Authority (Fulcio), and stored in an OCI registry where it can be verified, discovered, and used in policy engines. Backed by SPIFFE’s reference implementation SPIRE, all cryptographic operations are rooted in a strongly attested universal identity control plane for distributed systems.This presentation will demonstrate how a zero trust supply chain architecture can be applied to build systems, through the use of Sigstore and SPIRE for a Federated, Verifiable, Zero-Trust Supply Chain. Additionally, TektonCD will be used as the example build system and in-toto as the example provenance format.",

What if namespaces are just the wrong tool, and we better invest into cluster-like isolation called workspaces, built deeply into the apiserver. The kcp project explors Kubernetes - with logical cluster support to implement workspaces - with ability to scale horizontally via sharding, towards 1,000,000 clusters - with novel API service models disrupting CRDs. In contrast to other projects like vcluster or OpenClusterManager, kcp challenges years old decisions in Kubernetes by going deep into API-Machinery and apiserver. Strategically, we reduce the size of clusters to those of namespaces, and by that open up the space between workspaces for innovation, while within a workspace kcp is just Kubernetes. Outline: 1. from namespaces to workspaces 2. APIExport and APIBindings, identity based security 3. scaling up kcp to 1,000,000 workspaces.",

The OpenSSF - FRSCA is an implementation of the CNCF best practices that aims to protect the build system, secure ingestion and enforce policy in the production environment to minimize the attack vectors associated with software supply chain. With the integration of Tekton Pipelines/Chains, Sigstore, SPIFFE/SPIRE, and Kyverno, we can create a holistic approach that can meet SLSA Level 3 from beginning to end. Utilizing CUE, admission controller and short-lived certificates, we can cryptographically and based on policy protect the cluster. Building off binary authorization, FRSCA can validate the signature and attestation to authorize until the next release cycle. FRSCA aims to be an implementable architecture that the open source community and end-user organizations can utilize to ingest and produce SLSA compliant artifacts.",

Once we understand what changes about how a packet travels through the kernel, we'll better understand how to observe it in the following steps. Next, in order to observe this packet on its journey they'll take a dive into the Kubernetes networking debugging space. How do you properly use debug containers to observe traffic between other containers? Once you have debugging capabilities, what tools can we use to observe the traffic? Using these tools, attendees will understand what is happening behind the scenes of a service mesh and how a packet travels within it.",

The challenges we meet are quite different from the practices of the internet industry, banking demand higher stability and security, at the same time, more complex historical architecture. For example, we need to handle the migration for diverse workloads from bare metal to serverless to provide a consistent experience. We must provide progressive rollout with traffic management to keep the stability without breaking any business continuity. We need to have insight for the application delivery and management process to meet the business SLO by observability, further more, to reduce the cost of resources and improve utilization.

In this talk, we'll look at some of the biggest success stories in enterprise open source software partnerships and some of the cautionary tales. The more an organization is involved in co-creating the open source packages they use, the more both the organization and the open source project benefit. This session is for everyone: open source maintainers, OSPO leaders, or open source advocates in large enterprises. At the end of our session, you'll be able to articulate the tangible and emergent benefits organizations and enterprises gain when they stop just consuming open source software and instead embrace \"Everyone can contribute.\"",

      "description": "In Kubernetes 1.23 we integrated the CEL expression language into open source Kubernetes, making it possible to support the vast majority of CRD validation use cases without a webhook. This includes multi-field validation rules, immutability checks and more.  And this is just the beginning, we plan to extend admission control to support CEL expressions as well, which will make it possible to replace far more of those operationally troublesome webhooks with a much simpler alternative. We're convinced this leads to a better development experience for anyone extending Kubernetes. And more importantly, it makes cluster operations simpler and safer.  Learn about this future of Kubernetes extensibility from a contributor who has been involved in Kubernetes extensibility for over 5 years, including the projects to bring CRDs and Webhooks to GA, and who has been involved in improving the stability of Kubnernetes control planes in GKE for years.  In this talk I'll introduce CEL and how we've integrated it into Kuberentes and answer questions including: What can you do with CEL in Kubernetes today? What future features are planned? Can there really a future where webhooks are the exception instead of the norm?",

Should you still use Kubernetes? Our client has embarked on a journey to build a smart energy metering solution for remote industrial plants. The solution aggregates data produced by IoT measurement devices to a central point on site before sending the data to the cloud. The challenge for us, of course, is the design of this central aggregation point on site. This talk describes how we analysed the requirements to decide on using Kubernetes (K3s) as a central aggregation point on site.

However, as supply chain attacks become more sophisticated, answering just this question is insufficient. Instead, we need to think about: “If TravisCI was compromised, which software is affected? With a bad actor in your supply chain, what's the blast radius?” There is a ton of information today in SBOMs, in-toto/SLSA attestations, etc. However, these documents observed individually provide limited information, but when put together and related, super-additively expand the knowledge base of our software supply chain. We built a supply chain knowledge graph tool to help better understand the relationships between artifacts and their metadata/identities. Through this high-fidelity graph, we not only answer the hard questions posed earlier, but also make new discoveries. For example, we found that most build-systems rely not only on obvious dependencies like gcc, but often overlooked projects like libpcre and sed.",

This nearly always starts with running software through deployments. While this can get us started, many of our high value use cases require more complex compositions. Operators provide engineers a way to extend the building blocks of Kubernetes to build higher level abstractions. These abstractions can codify complex setup requirements, standardise capabilities across an organisation, and more. An example of operators at work include the Prometheus operator. This helps teams get started with monitoring and alerting with packaging and providing sensible defaults across an array of associated tools including Prometheus (for metric gathering), Thanos (for metric retention), Alertmanager (for alerts), and Grafana (for graphing). In this workshop we will build a basic operator which will enable a hands on exploration into use cases and structures of operators in more depth.",

The machine gateways, the factory servers, and cloud deployments all run on CNCF certified K8s clusters and are, therefore, independent of a specific Cloud or Edge Service Provider. The Digital Twin architecture is fully declarative, based on Semantic Web frameworks like RDF and JSON-LD. We developed a special K8s operator to monitor and deploy the factory processes as Apache Flink jobs, defined with Streaming SQL. We will also describe our experience running K8s and Cloud Native in a manufacturing environment, especially the challenges we overcame with the machine builders and factory owners to make them comfortable with the Cloud Native and K8s approach.",

It’s an ongoing process to change how we use certain words. It's important to choose words carefully to convey the correct meaning and avoid harmful subtext or exclusion. Let's explore some of the tools and triage methods that it takes from an engineering viewpoint to make bias-free choices. How can you ensure that biased words do not sneak into code, UI, docs, configurations, or our everyday language? First, let's walk through how to take an inventory of assets from code to config files to API specifications to standards. Next, by placing those findings into categories, prioritize the work to substitute with inclusive alternatives. Let's examine some examples using both API and code assets. Next is a demonstration of how to automate analyzing your source code or documentation with a linter, looking for patterns based on rules that are fed into the tool. What's in the future for these efforts? Inclusive language should expand beyond English and North American-centered efforts. To do so, let's organize the work with automation tooling, as engineers do.",

This talk is about the search for the next step, a successor for CRDs in a post-operator world where service providers use CRDs as first-class API for the services they are building and offering to tenants. CRDs as we know them are installed in customer clusters, usually together with operators or controllers. With that they are under control of the users: - users can tweak the CRDs. - users are the ones updating and controlling the operators with all the complexity and pitfalls updating operators and APIs can have. This situation is not a good fit for today's problems, and it's mostly an artifact of how CRDs and their life-cycle were conceived years ago as a tool to add in-cluster concepts. This talk is about lifting CRDs up to be a first-class verhicle for APIs provided and consumed by different parties, without the operator-glue, in different clusters, standardized, securely and federated.",

      "description": "Over the past few years, edge computing has been thoroughly discussed, with different technology fields having varying views on what defines edge computing. But in the end, despite the varied use cases of telco, retail, industrial, etc., it's clear that edge is seen as an extension to the cloud and that everyone is interested in bringing their cloud-native infrastructure and applications to the edge. In this session we will focus on this migration. Can we identify common characteristics of edge native applications? How do we tackle some of the common issues like hardware diversity, resource constraints, network availability and more? Basic cloud-native principles are well known and represent a valuable resource for developers. They serve as a check-list for developers, instructing what to keep in mind in order to successfully develop and operate their cloud applications, such as considerations for scalability, observability, ease of deployment on the edge. In the same way we see edge computing as a superset of cloud computing, we can consider edge-native principles a superset of cloud-native principles. So instead of starting from zero, let's focus on additional considerations of the edge. Let's see what additional principles we need to consider for edge-native applications in order to enable successful projects. The CNCF IoT Edge working group has started working on a white paper that aims to define these principles. In this session we will present our progress so far and give a call to action to join the effort.",

      "description": "Getting an environment approved for production can be a painful process, case in point government and Department of Defense (DoD) which require the strictest of controls be met, however this is true for other highly-regulated industries. Engineering and security teams must validate that the security controls are satisfied while continuing to audit, except these are often siloed teams. Reviewing these standards is still an archaic and painful process of managing a spreadsheet or checking text boxes. In this talk, we will share how the Department of Defense is solving this by ensuring compliance through policy in order to capitalize on the promise of DevSecOps. Using Big Bang, a tool for providing secure-by-default environments with pre-integrated tools, and Iron Bank, a DoD repository of signed and hardened application images, along with Kyverno, a Kubernetes-native policy engine, teams are able to get compliant faster and reach mission-ready status sooner.",

      "description": "CNET is no stranger to the world of containers; having been an early adopter of Docker Swarm, we've been using containers for many years! Recently, we migrated our workloads to Kubernetes, and the CNCF ecosystem has been a core component of our tech stack. As we started our application modernization initiative, we quickly realized by utilizing tools like Prometheus, Cert-Manager, External DNS, Traefik Ingress controller, Open Policy Agent, and others, we could give our developers a robust environment. The Kubernetes-based platform is not only for Production but Development Environments as well. The consistency between environments has kept our error rates down and websites up! Let's look at the flexibility the open software platform has given our developers! Let's take a journey from the perspective of a requested change on the front door of the website! First, a Product Manager makes the request, then we can see how a developer makes the change to the codebase and how quickly we can give the product manager a sandboxed environment to validate the requested change. the whole process takes only a few minutes. All of this is possible using open technology and our cloud provider. Let us show you how these tools work together to accomplish this flexibility and scale!",

How do I run AI apps on nodes that are too small to fit the AI model? How to make it operationally simple? Lets discuss and demo! We’re all familiar with “cloud native” -but once we start to operate applications at the edge, we have to adopt a new set of principles and evolve our cloud-native paradigms. We deploy Apps at the edge to achieve lower latency or higher performance, to comply with data sovereignty regulations, to reduce transit cost or to perform near real-time decision making on local data sources. Developing and operating Edge apps requires us to answer questions like: How do I operate Apps across 1000s of locations, which are often hidden behind layers of NAT and have spotty cloud connectivity? How do I run computation heavy tasks, like AI apps, on a set of nodes where each node does not have sufficient CPU and memory to run the entire model? How do I deal with a heterogeneous environment, with x86 and ARM-based devices? Which additional tools do I need to assure compliance to data-privacy rules, run AI models that just don’t fit a single compute element, or perform federated learning in an efficient way?",

      "description": "Kubernetes has become a popular choice for container orchestration as enterprises embark on their cloud-native application journey. We have observed that while enterprises quickly adopt Kubernetes by building and deploying microservices-based applications, full software development lifecycle (SDLC) considerations such as continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) are often an afterthought. What does it take to incorporate DevSecOps practices into your CI/CD pipelines to deliver enterprise-grade cloud-native applications that adhere to best practices, and ensure a frictionless handoff between developers, operations and security? How do you make sure that your development, test, and production environments are consistent to deliver high-quality, secure, and reliable code at the velocity demanded by your business? In this talk, we will present all aspects of defining, building, and managing a secure software supply chain within your organization to deploy cloud-native applications into Kubernetes using a set of open standard based Tanzu Application Platform and DevSecOps best practices. We will also cover how supply chain choreography helps you define a delivery system with infrastructure as code while keeping it tools and programming language agnostic.",

Historically this rich functionality often came at the expense of performance. However, recent innovations and new implementations of the Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) have transformed the Kubernetes networking landscape. Some classes of scientific computing workloads are highly network-intensive: sensitive to network performance to a degree that renders them unsuitable for execution in a Kubernetes context. In machine learning, the most demanding distributed training applications are also becoming increasingly network-intensive. The CNIs now available offer different architectures and technologies. Many claim performance advantages over their predecessors. How can we distinguish between them? In this talk we describe the leading CNIs, and use real-world benchmarks to compare and analyze performance for demanding workloads.",

We will show how we collect, process, and analyze in-cluster data in real-time and how our Numalogic computes anomaly scores for each deployment. This DAG-based ML platform has now been adopted by Intuit and helps our ML engineers focus on writing just the inference and pre/post-processing logic while the platform takes care of building the dynamic execution model, retries, buffering between the vertices, back-pressure, conditional-forwarding, and auto-scaling.

These VM images are tailored to the application itself and have high-performance, low resource usage (e.g. 3-5ms boot times, MBs of memory and disk usage, to name a few metrics) and a small attack surface (e.g.: no co-processes, no shell). We make comparisons across the current runtime landscape and demonstrate how you can use Unikraft with Kubernetes today.",

Security Teams don’t necessarily have the expertise to detect state-of-art attack scenarios specific to cloud-native environments, like Kubernetes. So, where do they get started? Capture-The-Flag (CTF) events are a great way to learn about the techniques of both attack (Red Team) and defence (Blue Team). This talk will give you a framework for your own internal CTF events, with Red and Blue Team assessments, as a best practice for improving security in your organisation.

This feature is coming to Kubernetes, thanks to user namespaces, and we'll tell you all about it.User namespaces is a kernel feature that isolates the user in the container from the one in the host. A process running as root in a container can run as a different (non-root) user in the host. This is a HUGE improvement: if a process escapes the container, the privileges on the host are significantly reduced. Furthermore, some capabilities are void and others are only valid inside the user namespace.Many container workloads that run as root today can benefit from this already: enable user namespace in their pod yaml and be more secure without additional changes.This talk will explain how to use this feature in your cluster, how it is implemented, the current state of the KEP and future work and challenges in this area.",

      "description": "Using GitOps automation to deliver Kubernetes cloud native applications allows management of infrastructure in the same way you manage application code, but lacks the supply chain controls needed to ensure integrity and tamper-proof deployments. Whilst application source dependencies have quickly benefited from SBOMs, transparency logs, and cryptographic signatures, delivery side automation has not participated in the end to end integrity guarantees. Using CD Gitops, Kubernetes manifests are composed from multiple source assets, across several locations, each having their own potential sources of malicious or accidental tampering. Template based mutations occur throughout continuous deployment and prohibit typical signing and verification methods. This talk describes how a properly instrumented CD GitOps process can be extended to provide verification of source assets with cluster enforcement of signatures and policy permissions. By combining keyless signing via Sigstore and intersecting control points throughout GitOps, accurate cryptographic signing of source assets can be obtained and transparency of configuration provenance produced. Finally using an admission controller such as integrity shield, cluster enforcement validates pipeline integrity.",

In this talk, we examine what's possible once we arrive at IPv6-only clusters. We present recent advancements in Cilium's networking data plane enabling a low-latency architecture suitable for \"BIG TCP\"-based workloads requiring IPv6 for 100Gbit/s transfers and beyond for a single socket. In addition, we deep dive our path into achieving host networking performance characteristics for Pods through a new veth driver replacement we specifically developed for the kernel in context of Cilium.

As workloads migrate to the cloud many enterprise IT firms are seeing compute resources moving closer to where the data is created. Edge computing models have become far more attractive to many industries like telecom, farming, public safety, retail, medical, etc., because of the ability to minimize network latency and to put essential functions closer to the technology consumer. The rate at which Kubernetes has been adopted to run these workloads have been exponentially increasing as is seen with 5G network deployments. How do we secure these workloads? Be it ingress, pod to pod (mTLS) security, and trust domains. How do we manage certificates and renewals at scale? How do we enable security policies and postures on edge locations? The talk will go through how to manage security at the edge using cert-manager and utilizing SPIFFE as a way to manage and distribute trust.

      "description": "You have a principled process for releasing your Kubernetes app that involves load testing, benchmarking and validation of service-level objectives (SLOs). But, will your app perform well when your cluster is subject to compute, memory, i/o, or network stress? In this talk, we will explore a novel approach that combines chaos injection for probing weaknesses in your Kubernetes infrastructure, with load testing, benchmarking and performance validation with SLOs for your app. The core thrust of our approach will be flexibility combined with simplicity. Your app may be cluster-local or externally exposed, may implement an HTTP or a gRPC endpoint, may have been specified using built-in or custom Kubernetes resources, may use any type of horizontal or vertical autoscaling, may use any CD/GitOps process for deployment, and you may be interested in probing your cluster by injecting compute, memory, i/o, network, or any other types of chaos. Regardless of these variations, this talk will demonstrate a dead simple way to automatically launch the unified “chaos + performance validation\" experiment whenever the app is updated, and automatically notify an event receiver with metrics and SLO validation results once the experiment is completed.",

However, a signature alone is insufficient for ensuring the security of a software artifact. Come learn about The Update Framework (TUF), the technology used by sigstore, Notary, Google Fuchsia, and more to not only sign software, but determine which keys should be used and prevent known attacks on software update systems. We will give an overview of TUF that describes its security features and how it has been integrated into fields as diverse as container registries and automobiles. We will also discuss new features we are working on to better support secure software distribution at scale, usability, and some emerging uses of TUF.",

      "description": "While there was considerable Observability coverage across Intuit’s backend services, detecting, quantifying and isolating customer impact had been a challenge. Oftentimes, service degradation was detected but teams were unable to quickly assess customer impact and map issues back to end user experience. Over the past year, Intuit leveraged OpenTelemetry to build a new capability called ‘Failed Customer Interactions (FCIs)’ that automatically detects, quantifies and isolates customer impact. The team built a simple to use abstraction that reduces the complexity of distributed tracing while leveraging its benefits. We will cover how the RUM-FCI capability powered by OpenTelemetry can not only reduce the time to detect incidents, but also isolate root cause at speed, with an explicit focus on customer impact. With this solution Intuit established a blueprint to reduce its MTTD from over 30 minutes to less than 3 minutes.",

To solve this issue, all of the major registries have come together to form the OCI Reference Types Working Group. This group has been tasked with determining how to describe and query relationships between objects stored in an OCI registry. This means potential changes to the registry HTTP API (distribution-spec) and/or associated JSON schema (image-spec). Josh and Sajay will describe the ways in which the OCI plans to address these topics with backwards compatibility in mind.

Kubernetes has tried to maintain this defining characteristic even as scenarios continue to expand. The device plugin interface was introduced to Kubernetes back in v1.10 to enable requesting and reserving static hardware for workloads, such as GPUs for ML applications. What about other devices used by workloads? This talk will cover several stories of how different types of the devices can be used in Kubernetes clusters: - From traditional datacenters to small IoT centric devices. - From exclusively accessed to shared devices. - From local stateless devices to network attached devices. - From simple single-purpose devices to pipelines of devices. All these scenarios require both a simple yet flexible UX for users to request a variety of devices with various properties. Alexander and Kate will discuss projects and proposals in the Kubernetes ecosystem that are working towards this goal of connecting devices and workloads. They will also discuss how to get involved in this evolution to let workloads be utterly materialistic. Whatever the app needs, it shall get.",

      "description": "The Cloud Native ecosystem is a complex topic. While most things start with Kubernetes as a foundation, a stack can vary wildly, even when sticking only to CNCF-accepted projects. In addition to the technical aspects, there’s also community, docs, and governance to be aware of when looking to contribute (and often even consume) these technologies.  Never fear, for Bob Killen (Google) and Jeffrey Sica (CNCF) are here to provide attendees a map of the land(scape). Both have been active consumers of, and contributors to, CNCF projects for years. In this talk, Bob and Jeff will guide attendees through what a Cloud Native stack looks like, the common problems that different projects look to solve, and how Community plays a big part in this technology.Coincidentally, both have also been residents of Southeastern Michigan for most of their lives! Therefore the talk will be chalked full of analogies to Detroit Style Pizza, Coney Dogs, and Automobiles to celebrate their home state and the wonderful city of Detroit.",

When taking the decision to standardize on Argo CD we needed more than a standard implementation. We needed a plan for scale! Argo CD is incredibly powerful, both for its ease of use and for its scalability to manage applications across many target environments. At Adobe, Argo CD started at the grassroots and has grown into something more substantial, the time came to take a more strategic approach to make sure security, scalability, and management are done right. Leveraging Cluster API, VCluster, and a holistic approach to scaling we’ll cover performance benchmarks to help you plan out when you need to divide up instances, as well as security, access, and other considerations when planning for growth. We’ll also demonstrate the right techniques for RBAC, SSO, and other tools to help you scale more effectively. If your organization is starting to grow with Argo CD, you don’t want to miss this talk.

Although this has helped reduce time-to-value for real-world AI use-cases, it has come at a cost of complexity and interoperability bottlenecks. Each stage in the end-to-end lifecycle involves different stakeholders that make decisions and perform actions that can modify data and/or ML components with use-case-specific but ever compoinding risks, resulting in a growing need to ensure a minimum-level of metadata is collected, tracked and managed. This becomes growingly important due to the need to ensure relevant overarching compliance requirements, as well as architectural requirements on lineage, auditability, accountability and reproducibility. In this session we will dive into the challenges present in the metadata layer of large-scale systems, as well as tooling, best practices and solutions that can be adopted to tackle these challenges. We will discuss the rise of the metadata management systems, the challenges they have been able solve, as well as critical shortcomings where ecosystem-wide collaboration will be key from tooling-level alignemnt to ensure long-term robustness of these heterogeneous end-to-end platform.",

Migrations are difficult and at scale require significant engineering. This high barrier can deter organizations and place roadblocks on the way to becoming wholly instrumented with Prometheus metrics. Organizations also face challenges moving certain use cases from a metrics push model to Prometheus, such as exposing metrics from CI and CD, batch jobs and short running tasks. Using histograms at scale efficiently across many teams all using similar RPC libraries and migrating from a primarily percentile driven set of latency metrics that used to be aggregated centrally can be challenging without the right guidance for developers.

      "description": "The Node Resource Interface (NRI) was started as a subproject of containerd to provide OCI hook-like extensions as plugins which can perform extra actions outside the scope of CRI. This idea has since evolved into providing a common infrastructure for plugging extensions into CRI runtimes. Our proposed revision, which hopefully gets merged by the time of this presentation, turns NRI into a common runtime agnostic extension interface for plugging custom container adjustment logic into runtimes. It defines NRI using a formal protobuf protocol description and implements it as a set of ttRPC services. This improves the efficiency of plugin-runtime communication and enables straightforward implementation of stateful plugins. Our additions also expand the original scope of NRI, by allowing plugins to hook into virtually any of the pod and container life-cycle events and adjust a carefully chosen subset of container parameters. Integration to both containerd and CRI-O is available as experimental features. In this talk we'll take a closer look at how NRI and the plugins fit into runtimes, then cover some common and novel use cases, and example plugins for OCI hook injection and custom resource assignment.",

      "description": "As powerful as Kubernetes is out-of-the-box, it’s a reasonable bet that your organization’s baseline cluster includes more than just the core Kubernetes components. Service meshes, CSI drivers, admission controllers, and database engines are nearly ubiquitous additions to production-ready clusters. Crucially, these applications allow your organization’s development teams to focus on solving the organization’s unique challenges by building on top of robust third-party solutions that solve common industry problems, but vulnerabilities in third-party code can put the security of your clusters at risk. In this talk, the speakers will briefly review a few examples of real-world vulnerabilities in third-party applications commonly found in large Kubernetes clusters and describe just how they were discovered; demonstrate how critical some vulnerabilities can be; and then review clear, actionable steps your organization can take to help prevent third-party vulnerabilities from being the weak link in your clusters’ security.",

This statement captures the general feeling of many years of many End User admins who are tasked with managing Kubernetes clusters. In the last couple of years, however, the community has worked on several incremental changes that have improved the security posture of Kubernetes significantly. Good news is that they are simple and do not require weeks to get them right! In this tutorial, Pushkar Joglekar will take you on a journey of learning hands-on techniques, open source tools, and newer security enhancements that will make deploying a secure kubernetes cluster faster and a little bit easier. We will start with verifying signed kubernetes release images for any version of your choice, applying Pod Security Standards at cluster or namespace level and configuring Runtime SecComp Profile by default for all workloads in a cluster running on your own system. At the end we will tie all these security features to real world vulnerabilities and known attacks to get that fuzzy and warm feeling, on a cold October day in Detroit, of being able to prevent vulnerability exploits in your clusters because you applied what you learnt in this tutorial.

Multiple areas emerged in the industry, galvanizing solutions for components such as network, runtime, storage, and cluster provisioning. The maturity of the cloud native landscape is led by the wider adoption of enterprise and large organizations. However, for these companies deployment and handling of bare-metal infrastructure has always been essential. A pivotal tool to manage cross-provider infrastructure has been Cluster API, leading a unique and radical stance for Kubernetes distribution. In association with a model such as GitOps, Cluster API assembles a mechanism that leverages the concept of a \"cluster as a resource\". This talk will outline how cloud native tools, such as Tinkerbell and Cluster API unlock a robust deployment of bare-metal infrastructure. Attendees will acquire an understanding of why the usage of ClusterAPI and provisioning automation with GitOps tools, such as ArgoCD, is a powerful concept that leads an organization towards the discovery of a modernized provisioning model.",

      "description": "Image pull times pose a considerable challenge when optimising for fast container starts within Kubernetes, due to potentially large images or network topology, bandwidth and egress cost constraints. Container runtimes offer layer-based node-local caches which help improve pull-times when there’s high layer-reuse, but find their limits when clusters need to scale quickly or there’s little control over the images which are used. We present the results of our efforts to bring down pull times down, which brought about considerable pull time improvement. Our goal was to optimise performance and networking cost, without imposing limits on the container images themselves. We went through several iterations which combined eStargz, nerdctl-registry with an in-cluster IPFS deployment. Using an opportunistic pull-through caching mechanism, we were able to considerably bring image pull times down without imposing extra burden on users (i.e. folks deploying the pods). We have been operating this setup in production on gitpod.io for over six months. In this session we will provide insight into our learnings, backed by the real-world data and observations we have gathered.",

      "description": "Intuit has a few monolithic applications that are scaled horizontally by sharding. It is common practice to use a dedicated frontend layer to route requests to a specific application shard based on request attributes. The attributes used for shard determination are non static and include tens of millions of users and thousands of services. Hence maintaining a static mapping of these attributes to shards is not feasible. For maintainability and separation of concerns, a dedicated look up service could be used to store and retrieve this shard information. Currently at Intuit, the sharded routing is performed in a central API Gateway using this lookup service. However, as we move our monolithic applications to service mesh, our next step was to decentralize the sharded routing to happen on a client’s service mesh proxy. A service mesh that utilizes a client side proxy like Envoy does not have an out of the box support for lookup based dynamic routing to the destination shards. This session discusses and demos how Intuit uses WASM to extend Envoy in a service mesh to provide decentralized routing for a sharded application.",

While this freedom gives developers flexibility, creating a process that supports all teams across multiple cloud providers in a large, multi-platform organization with authorization \u0026 access controls was overwhelming. Intuit needed a solution for these challenges while keeping developer friction to a minimum. In response, we have created an open source project named Cello, which is a service for running IAC solutions via GitOps. By utilizing GitOps process with IAC, Cello improved developer velocity managing the lifecycle of cloud infrastructure, while maintaining flexibility \u0026 security standards.

These requirements together warrant a vendor-agnostic approach to chaos experimentation, preferably from a common control plane (read: Kubernetes) with the flexibility to add custom constraints around the fault injection process as well as the expectations (hypothesis) around them.

TiKV is one such storage system that has been used by hundreds of companies for their mission-critical systems. Although the infrastructure on the cloud has the advantages of elasticity and pay-as-you-go, all resources on the cloud are paid for, including computing resources, storage resources, gateway routing, and cross-AZ traffic. So when building a system on the cloud, you need to consider a variety of things that make the system cost-effective. First, I will briefly introduce some cloud infrastructure and its typical characteristics, local disk and cloud disk, layered elastic distributed file system, several types of computing resources, etc. Next, I will introduce how TiKV reduces data storage space, reduces write amplification, and reduces the amount of data transfer fee across availability zones, etc. Finally, we look forward to several potential ways that TiKV can improve cost performance on the cloud. I hope that some practices on cost-effective optimization in TiKV can give you some reference and inspiration.",

You could burn hours doing that while you risk more problems. What if you could instead get that same data without the headache of restarting prod? In this talk, I’ll show you how to magically collect this data using bpftrace. Bpftrace lets you capture lots of useful data (function arguments, return values, latencies of individual functions - just to name a few) without re-deploying pods. Bpftrace is very powerful, but can be complex to work with, especially in multi-node environments like a Kubernetes cluster.

In this talk, we look specifically at the Kubernetes native implementation of Open Feature and illustrate how multiple types of pod workloads can now leverage feature flags. Whether they are web servers, C processes or serverless functions, all can use either Kubeneters native primitives or remote configuration to enable experimentation in a new way. The speaker will walk through key project components such as FlagD and explain the design choices and usage of these services, including an overview of how this enables a complete feature flagging system; with further anecdotes of how multiple communities have collaborated on this project. This first-hand information from one of the project team maintainers will aim to excite and get people thinking about how they can implement feature flags in their own workloads.",

Some examples of areas we will cover will be memory throttling, disk latency targets, and pressure monitoring. We will discuss some of the active KEPS in k8s taking advantage of these new capabilities and future work in this space. cgroups underlie how resource management works in k8s and focuses on how to properly reserve, allocate, and isolate finite resources on nodes such as CPU, memory, disk, network, etc. This talk will cover the present and future of resource management in k8s. Starting from use cases, we will look under the hood at how kubelet utilizes the underlying linux kernel cgroups for resource isolation and what will change with cgroupv2.

This kind of advanced traffic control is possible with a Service Mesh like Istio. But the configuration needed to enable this for all versions of all services is complex and error-prone. In this session Matt will show you how to use an Operator which auto-generates the necessary config.

      "description": "Most people are well-aware of the benefits of GitOps for various workflows especially as it relates to Kubernetes deployments - it allows easy integration of approvals, verifiable change history and automation hooks. However, getting users to adopt a different way of working can be challenging - especially if it involves tools and methods that would be convenient for you, the administrator, but inconvenient for the end-user. So, what do you do when your end-users are not directly using Git in their day-to-day work, but you still want to add the benefits of GitOps to your deployments without slowing them down? Simple - you implement GitOps but hide the entire process from them! In this session, Éamon and Heds will take you through how they took an internal Grafana environment that had grown increasingly messy and unreliable due to usage by a rapidly expanding internal team - and transformed it into a repeatable, promotable, process-driven well-oiled machine fueled by GitOps, Kubernetes, Terraform and more - all without the end-users having to learn or interact with Git at all!",

      "description": "Large scale microservices architectures often rely on synchronous APIs to implement their functionality by communicating with a large number of other services. This pattern works well when all services are aware of when and how data changes. However, as the system size increases, the tight coupling and complexity can become difficult to maintain. A solution for this growing complexity is asynchronous message passing, where services register what types of messages they are interested in and submit messages to be broadcasted to the system. This highly decoupled system allows new services to be added without changing code of the existing components. In this talk, hear from Madelyn Olson, one of the Redis core maintainers and a software development engineer who will deep dive into best practices for implementing this asynchronous message design pattern. She will also demonstrate how to build, deploy, and monitor a highly scalable message broker system by using standard CNCF components, specifically Kubernetes and Prometheus, along with Redis, the “most loved” database.",

Yet, its configuration can be complicated and baroque, making it hard to know what is being scraped, or to properly enforce RBAC. Scaling also requires careful thought. However, there are an increasing number of ways to run Prometheus as “stateless”. How can we adopt this to solve these problems? This talk introduces an alternative, operator-based approach for running stateless Prometheus instances on Kubernetes by leveraging Prometheus as a node agent. This prompted rethinking how Prometheus configuration is done today, and led to new, simpler, and more opinionated CRDs. We will discuss trade-offs in the new configuration model and the challenges of running a fleet of node-agent Prometheuses at scale. The hope is this lowers the barrier to entry of managing Prometheus infrastructure, while still supporting features and access controls for enterprise users.",

For sandboxed runtimes like Kata Containers, this results in less efficient storage IO; there’s a tradeoff between ease of compatibility versus performant storage. So, what if getting the PVC to the container isn’t just a bind-mount away? There has been progress in Kata Containers and within the greater container ecosystem to allow for storage to be presented to the runtime in a more VM-friendly way that results in better IO performance as well as a better security profile. In this talk, we'll highlight the work done for direct storage assignment, as well as the challenges we’ve worked through with the node and storage communities, as well as KEPS to facilitate this pattern in CSI and Kubernetes. We will show how a well defined generic API can allow for efficient storage handling for all sandboxed runtimes.",

What happens to cloud native stacks, organizations which operate cloud stacks and to the operators when faced with an adversary who possesses a quantum computer? The issue necessitated the development of novel protocols and schema to protect the free flow of information across the internet. While public cloud providers are leading the industry charge in that aspect, the most popular reverse proxies, service meshes, and other commonly used software seems to not address those issues. In this panel we would like to share with you our work which includes the inception of quantum resistant cloud stack. We are porting Envoy and Istio to run quantum resistant cryptography algorithms across the stack thus incepting quantum resistant cloud native stack.

This session will demonstrate how feature flagging and life-cycle orchestration work together to automate feature releases. Keptn will be the orchestration layer to automate feature validation. It works with OpenFeature to control access to the feature itself, allowing automated tests to verify a feature before it's generally available to users. Keptn will then react on the test results by either progressively enabling the feature for all users or initiating a troubleshooting workflow using OpenTelemetry.",

      "description": "Everyone who works in MLOps tends to have a perception that limited cost and GPU is crucial. Kubeflow is a great open source, but it provides very little elements to handle efficient distributed learning through coupling tightly with GPU or by maximizing GPU utilization. 1. A simplified model uses a relatively small amount of GPU, as using the entire GPU capacity is considered as waste of resources. The Multi-Instance GPU applied to the NVIDIA A100 provides a technology that splits one GPU into up to 7 instances, and this presentation shows how to combine this top-notch technology with Kubeflow. 2. As the size of the model increases, distributed training becomes more necessary when using multiple GPU servers for efficiency. GPUDirect RDMA is a high-performance networking technology that directly communicates and processes GPU memory without CPU and system memory intervention. As a result, you can get tried and true experience, which improves GPU utilization and performance in Kubeflow.",

Using the Machine Learning Exchange (MLX), a Linux Foundation for AI \u0026 Data Sandbox Project, we demonstrate how Project CodeNet can be leveraged to classify code and analyze code complexity in three steps. Using DataShim we turn domain specific subsets of the data into Kubernetes Custom Resources. Running Jupyter notebooks on Kubernetes we use the datasets to train deep learning models. The models are then served for inferencing as Kubernetes Custom Resources using KServe. For each of these steps, MLX generates Kubeflow Pipelines on Tekton so data scientists are not required to write Kubernetes specific code.",

As the number of services, pods, and interconnections increases, the kernel overhead will use more compute cycles, thereby lowering throughput and increasing latencies.

The cloud provider can then optimize these operations in software or in programmable hardware, such as an IPU or DPU, without requiring any changes to the end user’s applications. In this panel, we discuss various approaches that share a common methodology based on existing Kubernetes APIs to improve performance, free up compute cycles, and preserve compatibility with existing cloud native applications.",

It's built on top of the long-term metric storage capabilities of Thanos, which provides utilization and saturation metric data stretching back over a 1 year period. From this, a predictive forecast model is constructed and used to predict future growth trends across hundreds of saturation points over the coming months. This practical talk demonstrates how we capture long-term metrics data in a scalable way using Thanos, how we use Facebook's Prophet library for building forecast models, and how we integrate this with Jupyter to generate a report complete with visualizations. It discusses the benefits of switching to a data-driven and repeatable approach to capacity planning, as well as some of the practical challenges of building the tool.

But this migration isn't simple. There are multiple ways to perform it, each one implying different tradeoffs; besides, Jaeger has some fantastic features (such as remote-controlled samplers or per- operation-based adaptive sampling) that could be lost during the migration, if best practices are not followed. In this talk, we’ll discuss some of the best approaches to the migration from Jaeger to OpenTelemetry, the different paths that organizations can take and its related implications, and what users can do to not lose any of the Jager functionality they really love when moving to OpenTelemetry. We will illustrate everything with a demo application, which will be using the Jaeger client at the start of the session and will have migrated to OpenTelemetry by the end.",

As a result, more and more projects have standardized on Kubernetes, utilizing Custom Resource Definitions to define the schemas for interacting with the functionality they offer. However, defining higher level types outside the context of an individual cluster is difficult due to the fact that the unique identifier of a type – its Group, Version, and Kind – are not globally universal. In this talk we’ll explore a proposal for content addressable storage of type definitions for Kubernetes, inspired by the OCI distribution specification. The focus will be on the ergonomics of the system, how it compares to existing packaging and installation mechanisms for Custom Resource Definitions, and what future use cases could be enabled by aligning on a shared standard. Live demos will illustrate the full workflow and serve as inspiration for subsequent collaboration.",

Developers are now deploying containerized applications outside of cloud centers on edge networks (e.g., serverless functions on CDNs), on edge devices (e.g., smart cars), and on SaaS (including databases) as embedded functions. In those use cases, the Linux container, with guest OS and support software, is too heavy, too slow, and not portable enough. WebAssembly (WASM) has emerged as a lightweight runtime for those applications. The WasmEdge Runtime and crun projects work together to make WASM a first-class citizen in the container ecosystem, running side by side with Linux containers in a single cluster, managed by existing container tools. In this talk, Michael will discuss how WASM fits into the container ecosystem, how to use container tools (e.g., CRI-O and containerd) to start WASM images, and how edge-optimized Kubernetes (e.g., KubeEdge / SuperEdge / OpenYurt) manage WASM applications.",
