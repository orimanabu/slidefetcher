      "description": "\n  View the AgendaFD.io (Fast Data) is the first truly open data plane project focusing on data IO performance, scalability, efficiency, and programmable flexibility for networking and storage. FD.io provides a modular, extensible userspace IO services framework that supports rapid development of high-throughput low-latency resource-efficient IO services. The design of FD.io is hardware, kernel, and deployment (bare metal, VM, container) agnostic. FD.io has been integrated with Kubernetes, OpenStack Neutron, and OpenDaylight to provide a drop-in upgrade for all of your dataplane needs.A key component of Fido is the Vector Packet Processing (VPP) library contributed at the foundation of the project. The commercial-ready code targetable to run on standard x86, ARM, and Power servers is already running in products on the market today. VPP when connected to DPDK for network I/O has shown to perform two orders of magnitude faster than currently available open source options implementing switching or routing workloads, reaffirming one of the core principles of FD.io: a focus on performance.Join us at the FD.io Mini summit at KubeCon+CloudNativeCon in Copenhagen, to hear and learn from FD.io community experts who will be sharing information about the projects, use cases, capabilities, integration between FD.io and Kubernetes/ODL/OPNFV/Other communities, tools and many more exciting topics. This is a great opportunity for the KubeCon+CloudNativeCon attendees to share their thought leadership and innovations at one of the industry’s premier events. Beverages and breaks will be provided.Registration: Add this workshop on your KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe conference registration here.

How does service resolution work? Or how Kubernetes instructs Docker Engine.Security run-time monitoring and forensics (~1h): Last but not least, all these previous lessons can also be applied for security, not only doing forensics on an attack attempt. Sysdig Falco can alert on containers with anomalous behavior.Speakers: Michael Ducy \u0026 Jorge Salamero SanzBios:Michael Ducy currently works as Director of Community \u0026 Evangelism for Sysdig where he is responsible for growing adoption of Sysdig’s open source solutions.

Such systems in distributed machine learning community often have special requirements and may involve additional efforts.  This talk discusses the usage of CoreDNS for service discovery on distributed TensorFlow clusters for resolving deep learning problems.  While CoreDNS has been widely used for service discovery in Kubernetes, its unique plugin based design allows CoreDNS to be easily extended and deployed in non-traditional distributed systems as well.   Deployed on cloud (AWS), our distributed TensorFlow clusters have been greatly helped by CoreDNS for robustness against partial node failures. The deployment has also been simplified for non-DevOps (e.g., machine learning researchers) to launch and execute deep learning tasks at great ease.\n",

Not only tons of logs are caused by polling data from each Kubernetes node, thousands of API calls also causes high CPU usage of OpenStack control nodes. OpenStack Cinder provides a natural fit to support Persistent Volume. But due to volume attaching is an interaction between Nova and Cinder, it leads to issues under large scale. Scaling out Kubernetes degrades service performance drastically because all nodes are inside OpenStack loadbalancer member pools, enabling health monitor or not can make a difference in performance.\n",

In this talk we introduce Apache Beam. A unified programming model designed to provide efficient and portable data processing pipelines. We will discuss in detail how Beam achieves portability by relying in two concepts: (1) Runners that translate the Beam's model so it can be executed in existing systems like Apache Spark and Apache Flink and (2) the portability APIs, an architecture of gRPC services that coordinate the execution of pipelines in containers to accomplish language portability.\n",

It is even harder on Kubernetes since the deployments are, rightfully so, safely guarded by the API Server of the cluster. Organizations tend to lockdown the API Server, restricting the ability to use an external CI tool. Using external CI tools thus comes at a cost of security, access, and ease-of-use. Nearmap dealt with these challenges using intrinsic Kubernetes principles. We use CircleCI, Amazon Web Service (AWS) Elastic Container Registry (ECR) and a custom Kubernetes controller to achieve a declarative configuration approach to continuous deployment. In this talk, we discuss the challenges faced, provide an in-depth analysis of our declarative CI/CD approach and how Nearmap is enabling self-managed continuous deployments of Kubernetes clusters.\n",

There is no integration with Swagger/OpenAPI. Polished alternatives to GUIs like Postman or Swagger UI don't exist. Providing a REST interface over the gRPC services can solve these problems. We present a brokerless solution, using a Protobuf compiler plugin to generate a library of RESTful controllers with Swagger/OpenAPI documentation.

And then with the rise of Kubernetes community, all those container runtimes begin to become quite and hidden behind the orchestration layer, which is expected. But in 2017, we begin to hear more voice of container runtimes again. cri-o, containerd, Kata. But why? In this talk, we would like to say something about technical details of CRI, the killer weapon which brought new energy to \"boring\" container runtimes. We will introduce what is CRI spec and shim, how they are designed, how they work with CNI and CSI, also, what's the difference between those shims and why Kata is special. We will also demo how to write a CRI shim from zero. The second boom of containers is around, while this time it happens in Kubernetes community.\n",

Telepresence allows you to develop services locally as if they were running in your cluster. It does this by proxying pods to your local machine and gives your local services seamless access to service discovery and volumes. With Telepresence, you no longer have to maintain Docker Compose files for local orchestration, and you can take full advantage of Kubernetes features such as Ingress, Secrets/ConfigMaps, RBAC and more.

      "description": "\n  The New York Times has been on the Internet since 1996. Long before most Internet or tech giants even existed. The Times is one of the most trafficked news sites on the Internet today with a fairly complex set of services and modules driving our internet presence.  We have been using public clouds since 2010 but In 2016 we decided to go all in with the intent to retire our data centers in 2018. As a result one of the biggest projects we undertook was moving our website, CMS and a slew of other internal tools to Amazon and Google's cloud offering. We jumped on the Kubernetes bandwagon and have had a hell of a ride. A lot of our learnings were not technical but cultural.  As we went down this path, we found ourselves embracing open standards and tools. We also had learned how to work with product teams who were at various levels of maturity and discipline w.r.t. CI/CD and SRE concepts.\n",

      "description": "\n  In the Kubernetes world, there is a need to build observability around apps and backing services deployed in Pods. The observability should allow to capture on demand low level metrics at a very low overhead. The proposal is to use ebpf as the tracing technology to capture details at kernel and user level, and generate on demand flamegraphs, heat maps for applications \u0026 backend services. The in-kernel BPF JIT compiler, bpf program verifier and in-kernel storage maps implementation allow users to run the programs in kernel that can never interfere with the kernel negatively, without much overhead. These features make eBPF programs safe to run in production, and allow admins and engineers to collect crucial data from systems for performance analysis and monitoring.

      "description": "\n  Containers have had uncanny abilities to build, manage, and distribute changes as part of the container’s filesystems through the use of layers and graphdrivers. A critical part of the magic making people’s experience with containers delightful, this is considered a necessity in any container-based system. The complexity and integration of graphdrivers makes working with them directly cumbersome and error prone.containerd departs from this and introduces a new abstraction, known as “snapshotters”. Mounting a container’s filesystem, direct manipulation, arbitrary diffing, and native copying, previously a challenge, are all now possible with minimal effort. In this talk, we’ll cover the evolution of Docker’s graphdrivers to containerd snapshotters, demonstrating the wonderful properties of snapshotters in the process.\n",

The security concerns related to that level of isolation could be mitigated by using hardware virtualization for both pods and traditional (legacy?) workloads.

We'll be describing how both projects leverage CPU virtualization to implement a stronger security architecture for Kubernetes. When combining both approaches, one can run a wider range of workloads, from untrusted containers through Kata Containers to more traditional, lift and shift applications with KubeVirt.\n",

Complementary, interlocking open source technologies like Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes and the Open Service Broker API are shifting the way industries function. These technologies weave together flexibility and application development for virtually any type of business. What began as a grassroots movement among developers has mushroomed into a massive collaborative community. Linux laid the groundwork in 1991, and the Linux Foundation continues to host the world’s leading open source projects. Today, projects like Cloud Foundry and Cloud Native Computing Foundation, as well as standards like the Open Container Initiative, effectively serve as the voice of the people. The developers creating these projects are defining the next generation of technology infrastructure.In this talk, Abby Kearns will discuss the importance of interoperability, and how it is critical to the future success of technologies.

      "description": "\n  Software development today is more rapid, more distributed and more dynamic. As a developer, you really want to be able to focus your time on creating new solutions. But as much as you might want to ignore it, you still have to ensure the apps you build scale, stay up and stay secure. Developers still need to understand and control the software supply chain: you still need to know who built what. You need to understand if your software is vulnerable, compliant with your processes and regulations, and secure. And you need to know what is running right now, where it is running, and to be able to control when it changes.  So the trick is how to spend as little time as possible on these issues so you can focus on building your app. The combination of Kubernetes and Cloud can make that happen for you. At IBM we are focused on helping you focus. The IBM Cloud Container Service, which leverages Kubernetes, provides advanced capabilities for building cloud-native apps, adding DevOps to existing apps, and ultimately relieves the pain around security, scale, and infrastructure management. \n",

Israel explains how Moltin systems started as a monolithic beast that needed a full architectural revamp to decompose it into microservices. In shifting to microservices, several key concerns presented themselves and his team was able to use Linkerd throughout the process to solve practical problems.

There are also many challenges to designing a distributed system that can maintain high consistency, reliability, and availability.

The addition of load balancers introduces new points of failure in a cluster and hinders observability since source IPs are either NAT’d or masqueraded.  This talk will be a deep dive of how DigitalOcean uses BGP, Anycast and a variety of open source technologies (kube-router, CNI, etc) to achieve a fast and reliable container network where Pod and Service IPs are reachable from anywhere on DigitalOcean’s global network.

Kubernetes, and more broadly Cloud Native, presents us with better ways to handle our infrastructure. For example, when we need to upgrade to a newer Kubernetes version, we can use automation and tooling to create a new cluster and migrate existing workloads over to it.  In this talk, Andy will describe different strategies for moving workloads between clusters. He'll show you how to use tools such as Ansible and Kubeadm to quickly install a new cluster, along with Heptio Ark to back up one cluster and restore into a new one. Andy will also demonstrate how you can perform zero-downtime migrations using Envoy for cluster ingress, traffic shifting, and some DNS “magic.”\n",

The open source libentitlement library, being developed at Docker, enables similarly high level controls to be used for managing containers. The talk will also cover the relationship with Open Policy Agent and other access control frameworks, and relation to Linux Security Modules and PodSecurityPolicy.\n",

      "description": "\n  Observability and monitoring are different, but complementary, needs for production applications. While monitoring focuses on measuring the overall health of your systems, observability aims to provide granular metrics that describe the behavior of your systems along with their context. Due to both its architecture and focus on providing observability, the service mesh can be a powerful debugging solution when trying to figure out what went wrong with your cloud native applications.  In this talk, Franziska shows you how to debug your Kubernetes applications using features of a service mesh in tandem with use of other CNCF projects like OpenTracing. She compares and contrast two different debugging techniques using both Linkerd and Conduit. After attending this talk, you’ll be able to use either approach to debug your Kubernetes-based applications.\n",

Can Kubernetes and OSBAPI also give us the open connected home consumers dream of?  With Kubernetes used as a command and control platform for a connected home with a diverse collection of devices, complex interactions between currently incompatible devices becomes possible. With OSBAPI as the method of interoperability, it can also solve the challenge of a cloud based Kubernetes cluster controlling a on-premise Service Broker without a consistent internet connection or blocked in-bound network communication.

As an example they will use a heat-aware scheduler that was developed by Nerdalize to allow them to schedule compute jobs to servers where more heat is needed.  This unique need arises from the situation that Nerdalize builds a distributed datacenter, where servers are placed into households, and double as water heaters. After someone takes a shower, their boiler needs to be re-heated. This scheduler allows us to move high-cpu workloads to those servers.\n",

They outline exciting use cases for edge, including machine learning, virtual/mixed reality, video, transportation, and natural disaster detection. Then, they discuss what makes an application \"edge-ready,\" from storage and network requirements to multitenancy and security. Finally, they demonstrate, using a prototype edge management platform built on top of Kubernetes, the process of deploying an edge application to multiple microdatacenters at once.Note: This demo and our team’s prototypes in Edge Computing are not part of any official Cisco products.\n",

If you have access to automated infrastructure, e.g. via a Cluster API controller, you should be able to do CI testing of your cluster, as well as CD of new configuration and versions. Some call this pattern “GitOps”; to write the desired cluster state declaratively and let a controller reconcile the cluster state.

This talk will dive into three different approaches to compose FaaS functions together to form large applications:  _Coordinating Functions_ are functions that manage the execution of other functions by calling them directly.  _Event-driven Composition_ uses functions emitting and reacting to events on message queue topics.  _Workflows_ introduce a mechanism for expressing a graph of function interactions and having a new runtime to manage the execution of these functions.  We'll give examples and live demos for each approach, and compare then on the basis of expressiveness, performance, and fault-tolerance; and also on the basis of operational concerns, such as the ease of doing upgrades, and monitoring the overall application's performance.\n",

      "description": "\n  The Xiamio Mi Vacuum Robot is an affordable bit of kit, yet comes with a powerful SoC and utilises a wide range of sensors. A talk at 34C3 last year showed how to gain root access to the underlying Ubuntu Linux operating system.  Based on this groundwork, the talk will explain how the vacuum can be provisioned as a node in a Kubernetes cluster. From then on, well-known Kubernetes primitives can be used to control it: CronJobs periodically schedule drives, and a custom Prometheus exporter is used to track metrics about a vacuum’s life.  Using custom controllers and CRDs, extended features of the vacuum can be utilised: requesting raw sensor readings, dumping a map of your home, and allowing the vacuum to drive custom paths.\n",

Simultaneously, its becoming accepted wisdom that the developers of a given software package are best placed to operate said software, or at least construct the basic monitoring configuration.  In this talk we present a technique for using Jsonnet (a configuration language from Google) for packaging and deploying “Monitoring Mixins” - extensible and customisable combinations of dashboards, alert definitions and exporters. This technique allows developers of open source projects to publish best-practice monitoring configurations alongside their code, and for users to consume it, customise it and stay up to date. We will present example Mixins for Kubernetes and other services such as Consul and Cassandra.\n",

Kubernetes as of release 1.9 supports both application auto-scaling based on metrics such as CPU utilization and cluster node auto-scaling based on application workload (pods) needs. Kubernetes also supports cluster federation, which enables binding of multiple clusters into a single observable unit from the point of view of a user. This presentation will discuss how we’ve used these features to reliably burst from a priority/low cost cloud cluster to another, using Kubernetes.

A service mesh, instantiated by Istio, provides a new paradigm for connecting, managing and securing microservices. With services running in multiple clouds, the service mesh has to be established across clouds. In this presentation John and Robert will show how an application can be stretched between two disparate cloud environments--public cloud and on-prem private cloud. The demonstration will show how the service mesh is stretched to fully enable service mesh features for all services and endpoints in both cloud environments. The summary will discuss how the Istio community has addressed this problem.\n",

But what do you do with slow response time when you have application deploying at scale? Slow response time is just a symptom, the root causes might be incorrect CPU/Mem limit configuration, incorrect number of replicas, underlying infrastructure congestion, or, a combination of the above. The corresponding way to solve it could be vertical scale the container, horizontal scale the pod, or reschedule the pod to a different node. In this presentation, we are going to share our lesson and knowledge about managing containerized application performance by leveraging the telemetry information from Istio to assure the application SLA\n",

With this ubiquitous ability to run your applications comes a need for persistent storage that also runs anywhere Kubernetes runs. One of the most powerful features of Kubernetes is the ability to deploy your applications consistently no matter what the environment is. The same should be true for your storage if you want to realize the full potential of Kubernetes.  We will walk through the architecture of Rook (https://rook.io/), a distributed storage orchestrator for Kubernetes that provides storage to your application pods anywhere Kubernetes runs. We’ll explore how to use extension mechanisms such as CRDs as well as patterns like controllers/operators, resource management, and rolling upgrades to build a portable Kubernetes storage solution.\n",

      "description": "\n  Starting about a year ago, the Technical Operations team of the Wikimedia Foundation (aka WMF), the organization that runs wikipedia, decided to embark on a journey pushing for streamlined service/microservice delivery. The project is still ongoing. During the build-out of the kubernetes clusters that are going to power the services responsible for Wikipedia, there were a number of interesting decisions that had to be takenr regarding the networking implementation, the routing of external traffic, the chosen bootstrap method for the clusters and the building methodology for containers and last but not least the transition plan from the old style services to the kubernetes style services. This talk is about sharing these implementation decisions with a wider public\n",

      "description": "\n  Kubernetes offers a set of features which, when used in the right combination and configured properly, enable secure multi-tenant clusters. But it’s not always obvious how to map particular multi-tenancy requirements to those features and configurations. As a result, people often resort to spinning up one cluster per user and/or workload, thereby foregoing the utilization and management benefits they could achieve by using a single shared cluster. This talk will describe a taxonomy of various multi-tenancy models that are possible on Kubenetes today, and how to configure the existing security/multi-tenancy features to satisfy each of those use cases. We will then describe some features that are on the horizon to provide even stronger, easier-to-use multi-tenancy in Kubernetes.\n",

Sarah will share real-world production use cases that illustrate how developers are using these technologies together.\n",
