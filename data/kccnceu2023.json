      "description": "What are Software Operators?Software operators are crucial in the Kubernetes landscape; They help human operators and administrators run their applications efficiently and effectively. At Canonical, we redefined how to operate applications through an OSS-based platform and framework for building and running operators with Juju, the Charmed Operator Framework. Although a software operator is often associated with Kubernetes, operators can cover applications for many substrates: bare metal servers, private clouds, public clouds, and Kubernetes clusters. Juju offers a mature, consistent, intuitive user interface for integrating applications for all substrates. Why attend operator day?We launched Operator Day at the KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America conference in 2020. Since then, we have proudly hosted 5 Operator Day events with various sessions presenting industry leaders redefining the operators' landscape. The 6th Operator Day is a must-attend virtual event; it will cover the basics behind software operators, what they are, how to use them, how to create them, and how your team can benefit from them. You can dial in from anywhere and watch use case presentations where software operators have been applied successfully across the entire stack: on VMs, private clouds, public clouds, or in a multi-cloud scenario.Please note that this is a virtual Sponsor-hosted Co-located event.For questions regarding this event, please contact: julia.obraztsova@canonical.comFor details please visit: https://app.myonvent.com/event/operator-day",

      "description": "When Mauricio started working on Kubernetes one of his first tasks was to run the Kubernetes storage e2e tests with a CSI Driver, e2e tests run by compiling the e2e test codebase onto a binary called e2e.test, while running tests Mauricio wanted to stop at some specific part of the test to check the status of the cluster which previously required adding sleep statements in the test and recompiling the e2e.test binary, as Mauricio was learning go tooling he found Delve which enables setting breakpoints on go programs but saw that it wasn't integrated with the way Kubernetes run e2e tests. Mauricio added a way to debug the e2e tests with Delve, in this talk Mauricio will talk about how Delve works and how it's used with the e2e.test binary to debug tests. This talk is for people that want to contribute to Kubernetes but don't know where to start, in Mauricio's opinion you can start from the e2e tests and by setting breakpoints and analyzing the cluster state based on what the test does you'll understand how Kubernetes works.",

Technical writing is one such field where you can learn about Cloud Native concepts and present them to users ranging from novice to experienced developers. Technical writing will also assist you in getting started with your code contributions. In this lightning talk, Karuna will discuss how to get started with documentation contributions, technical writing principles, and opportunities to get their hands dirty by contributing to documentation of various CNCF projects.

Armada is a Sandbox project in the CNCF and its main focus is enabling batch processing across multiple kubernetes clusters. Armada defines APIs for integration and has released a python API. A primary goal of these APIs is to enable integrations with other open source projects. The users at G-Research wanted to use orchestration software to enable the scheduling of multiple tasks on Armada. The open source decided to build an Airflow Operator that allows G-Research users to take advantage of Airflow’s integrations. In this talk, we will briefly introduce Armada and our integration with Airflow. With this integration, Airflow is now able to schedule jobs on multiple Kubernetes.",

      "description": "This talk will describe GreenCourier in detail, present experimental results, and motivate the development of other carbon-aware solutions in the cloud ecosystem. GreenCourier targets a new cloud computing paradigm called Serverless Computing aka Function-as-a-Service, in which users are only responsible for writing small pieces of code called functions while all infrastructure management is handled by the cloud service provider. To reduce carbon emissions on function invocations, GreenCourier incorporates an intelligent scheduling policy for Kubernetes that schedules serverless functions across geographically interconnected Kubernetes clusters depending on their carbon-efficiency. To this end, GreenCourier implements a scheduling plugin for Kubernetes based on the Scheduler API that obtains periodic information from the carbon-aware sdk to determine the carbon-efficiency of a geographical region. As the FaaS platform, GreenCourier utilizes the serving component of Knative. On function invocation, GreenCourier listens for the creation of Knative objects and automatically schedules them on the most carbon-efficient region. For seamlessly establishing geographically distributed Kubernetes multi-cluster topologies, GreenCourier utilizes Liqo based on the Virtual Kubelet.",

Don't fear; these are not your enemies but rather a living example showing what it takes to reach the same level. Being level 1 at anything is hard, but you can quickly gain experience and level up with a simple shift in how you're already working. If you're already writing code to help you solve a problem, can you push it upstream? If you're teaching your friends the latest tech tips, can you expand your audience? If you're analyzing security trends on your internal systems, can you apply your learnings to an open-source project? With these small shifts, you are now ready to start leveling up. Not only can you level up your character, but you can level up projects. Looking at the project status will let you know the storyline difficulty. Kubernetes (main storyline mmorpg+irl) Graduated (standard) Incubating (hard) Sandbox (challenging) When you choose to work together, every XP you gain for the project earns double XP for the players in the party. So build your team, find your quests, smash some PRs, and level-up. Join me in this talk to learn how to get your player card and level up in the CNCF today!",

Maybe you think that you don't have anything to say or that you'd never have the courage to present in public. In this short talk, Paula will answer some frequently asked questions (FAQs) on what a \"Call for Proposals\" (CFP) actually is, how to go about finding one that is the right fit for you and how you should approach it. She'll share some of her experiences and provide some simple advice that will help guide the audience through the process. Following this talk, the audience should have a better understanding of where to start and the encouragement they need to submit to a Call for Proposal, perhaps even to the next KubeCon!",

      "description": "Have you ever operated a Kubernetes cluster for multiple developers? If you have, you probably realized quickly that things are going to be a lot smoother if you could just enforce some basic conventions. Maybe all your services have a well defined endpoint for the liveness probe but developers sometimes forget to set it up. Or maybe developers should always use a semantic version tag on their containers and avoid :latest. Or maybe there is a deprecated Kubernetes API field and you'd like to ensure it is never used in your cluster. In this talk we will run through a series of easy solutions to help enforce conventions using only YAML. You have a lot more control that you might realize. Learn from a Kubernetes contributor involved in the development of numerous extensibility features including CRDs, admission webhooks and admission policies. We will show you some handy tricks and leveraging new features including new features like Validating Admission Policies alpha API introduced in 1.26.",

      "description": "The Vanilla Kubernetes scheduler does not take power into account when placing pods on nodes and racks. As a result, the power usage of servers and racks in a data center can exceed the allocated power envelope and lead to service outages and costly downtime. In this short talk, Yuan Chen from Apple will give an overview of a new scheduler feature to support power-aware scheduling in Kubernetes. The proposed power-aware scheduling can protect power supply infrastructures and improve workload stability in large scale Kubernetes clusters by (1) enforcing power cap at both the server and rack levels, and (2) by optimizing pod placement to more evenly distribute workloads and power demand across servers and racks. The enhanced scheduling strategy is implemented by extending the default Kubernetes scheduler via scheduler plugins using the standard Kubernetes scheduling framework API. Specifically, power capping is implemented using the scheduler Filter plugin, and workload and power distribution optimization is achieved via the scheduler Scoring plugin. The improved scheduler can help safely increase server hardware and data center infrastructure size, and improve resource utilization and workload reliability for Kubernetes clusters.",

During this time we gradually discovered the main components of Kubernetes and carved out the main use cases as well as the specific needs of a scientific organization. The work was done in close collaboration between developers and infrastructure maintainers. The presentation aims to lower the barriers for entry into the Kubernetes ecosystem by presenting an example of a full cluster setup that leverages automation and provides an easy-to-understand experience for end users.

The providers we have to choose from tend to use legacy infrastructure, creating bottlenecks when teams need to incrementally build, test, and release. And for those which promise containerised builds, we then have to worry about the security of privileged docker-in-docker runs. That's our choice: slow spin up times, or a compromise on security. And this is before we even talk about the overhead, both cost and environmental, of maintaining a hot pool of nodes, which is what you would need to provide either solution with any decent degree of usability. Stranger still is that a solution may lie in the Old School: I'm talking bare-metal. Sort of. What's hot and new in this space are MicroVMs. Exactly as it sounds, MicroVMs are teeny VMs, giving the speed and flexibility of containers, with the security of regular VMs. The promise that MicroVMs can be a more performant and cost-effective CI model is catching on, and one such project making exciting progress is Liquid Metal.

The platform combines the need for infrastructure administrators to perform automated cluster actions of upgrading and autoscaling clusters with the application owner's workload protection against workload disruptions in the form of PodDisruptionBudget(PDB) policies. To further advance service availability, it is increasingly common for organizations to operate and deploy workloads that transcend Kubernetes Cluster boundaries addressing the requirement for a failure domain that spawns across multiple regions. The Kubernetes PDB policy protection is limited to a single namespace scope and cannot protect workloads distributed across multiple namespaces or clusters.

      "description": "Kubernetes policies are configuration objects that control other configuration and runtime behaviors. The Kubernetes Policy Working Group (WG) is charted with researching and developing policy implementations, architectures, and best practices for Kubernetes. In this session Jim and Frank will provide an overview of the Policy WG projects, deliverables, and activities, and then deep dive into the Policy Report API which is being proposed as a standard by the Policy WG to unify policy observability across different areas of Kubernetes security and automation. They will demonstrate how different engines and scanners utilize this API, and show how a common policy administration point can leverage the API to provide visibility across the continuous delivery pipeline. They will also detail how to get involved with the working group activity tracks to learn, contribute, and share in the areas of policy, governance, and compliance!",

      "description": "As we all know, Kubernetes cluster life cycle management is challenging. Imagine the herculean job of managing 1000s or more clusters on your clouds. Adopting Cluster API solves this problem to an extent by out-sourcing the burden to \"management cluster(s)\", which are expected to manage their children-workload clusters. However, it raises many new questions, like a) who manages these 100s of \"management clusters\" on gigantic clouds? b) scale issues on the management clusters c) how to enable multitenancy on the management clusters d) how to prevent management cluster admin from seeing workload cluster secrets e) HA, RBAC, Backup of the management clusters f) K8s version skew between management and workload clusters and so on. Can we get away with this overhead of \"Management clusters\" but still leverage all the richness of Cluster API? Yes, that is possible by transforming workload clusters into \"Self Managing\" clusters. Come to our talk and learn more about our journey on how we have productized the concept of \"Self-Managing\" clusters in our Multi-tenant cloud platform and our success story.",

Ideally, we would have many observability signals at our disposal to understand what happens and how to fix it: alerts, metrics, logs, and traces. Besides these traditional observability signals, the Kubernetes API also provides useful information such as resources’ metadata, status, and events. With so many different data sources available, the main challenge is making sense of this firehose of data and correlating the different signals in a meaningful way. The talk will focus on korrel8, a new open source tool, which aims - through the correlation of observability signals - at reducing the cognitive load of engineers when attempting to debug issues.",

In this presentation, speakers will present the “big picture” for these proposals, how they are interconnected, how they are different, which problems they are targeting to solve, and what they mean for Kubernetes users. This presentation will be helpful for cluster administrators and users to understand the future direction in their resource management area and give a framework for them to provide feedback that can help shape these future efforts.

Booting up a cluster and deploying a demo application, only to find the dreaded “Your connection is not private” message in your web browser. Attackers could be stealing your information, credit cards and passwords? Frankly, your sock shopping addiction should be nobody's business. Luckily I found the cert-manager project. As if by magic, this clever controller made my security woes fold away. What about secrets? API and service account keys. This highly sensitive data must be bolted to your pod to ensure it can access databases, api-servers and more. After accidentally committing raw secrets to Github (nobody got time for that), I grew tired. I crawled away into the wonders of Google Cloud Workload Identity. But wait? Haven't I given up on the wonder of multi-cloud Kubernetes? If only identity could come batteries included. As an encore in the machine identity space, cert-manager now leverages SPIFFE to solve this problem. Pods are empowered to enter the VIP lounge of their choice in whatever cloud, provided they are on the guest list. Don't believe me? Call me on my bluff. Join me as I explore how this industry problem has been solved using the same magic that gave us TLS on Kubernetes only a few short years ago.",

Your customers use Kubernetes and you want to let them easily consume your service in their Kubernetes workloads. Today, you would build an operator or perhaps a Crossplane provider. But not so long ago there was a Kubernetes project specifically for this use-case: the Service Catalog. The Service Catalog worked with the Open Service Broker API to allow management of hosted services via Kubernetes resources. It provided a standardized, vendor-neutral way to manage and connect to external services from Kubernetes workloads. It never really took off. Operators won the day, and the Service Catalog project was shut down in 2022. This talk explores both the limitations and the advantages of the Service Catalog model. We'll compare and contrast the Service Catalog with operators and Crossplane, and explore where each approach could learn lessons from the others. With that context in mind, we'll think about the future. Kubernetes users will continue to consume cloud services in their applications; what's the best way to facilitate that?",

To help facilitate this transition, we will cover OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation best practices to build a scalable trace pipeline to deliver this data to a Jaeger backend. Moving Jaeger from a tracing system to a monitoring system has been a big push for the project in the last year. Made possible by OpenTelemetry and the processor layer which allows for the creation of metrics derived from traces in the pipeline. Operational monitoring is now possible using the new monitoring tab, which adds metrics capabilities to Jaeger UI via another graduated project, Prometheus.

      "description": "What do you do when RBAC with namespaces aren’t enough to meet your multi-tenancy needs? Namespaces are easy to implement but they generally do not provide the level of isolation that is needed when working with external users. Instead of running multiple clusters, which are complex to manage, hard to scale and often costly, we turned to vCluster. vCluster is an open source project that allows you to create virtual clusters in any Kubernetes cluster. Virtual clusters enjoy higher isolation than simple namespaces and can also be used for cluster level resources like CRDs without any versioning conflicts. Using virtual clusters in the Codefresh’s hosted GitOps platform that is powered by thousands of Argo instances we enabled high isolation between tenants while lowering the cost of application multi-tenancy. For most companies, multi-tenancy means supporting multiple teams within an organization, or perhaps a partner. For us, multi-tenancy means providing access to the general public. We needed to go deeper than RBAC, namespaces, and auditing. In this end-user talk, we’ll share how we leveraged vCluster, Crossplane, and Argo CD to approach multi-tenancy, scale, and security in a totally GitOps fashion.

But the resource utilization of a production Kubernetes cluster is still quite low if accumulates by 24 hours, while Big Data workloads stabilize at a high resource utilization level. To address the low resource utilization issue on Kubernetes clusters, the industry would colocate online services and offline jobs in the same cluster usually. But how to ensure offline jobs don't affect the normal running of online services is very tricky. Offline jobs may occupy a lot of L3 caches, consume memory bandwidth, hold critical kernel lock and then affect the error rate and the latency of colocated online services. In this talk, we would share how we customize and extend Linux Kernel, Container Runtime, Kubernetes Scheduler, and Kubelet to improve resource utilization significantly while ensuring online services are running as normal. We would share why default cgroup CFS and memory limits are insufficient in complicated real-world scenarios and how to overcome them. We also would share Kubernetes restrictions on offline job scheduling and how we workaround it to save costs on purchasing computing resources for Big Data.",

From an end-users perspective, it moves away from the limited \"countable\" interface for requesting access to resources (e.g. \"nvidia.com/gpu: 2\"), providing an API more akin to that of persistent volumes. Using GPUs as an example, DRA unlocks a host of new features without the need for awkward solutions shoehorned on top of the existing device plugin API. These features include: * Controlled GPU Sharing (both within a pod and across pods) * Multiple GPU models per node (e.g. T4 and A100) * Specifying arbitrary constraints for a GPU (min/max memory, device model, etc.) * Dynamic allocation of MIG devices * Dynamic repurposing of a GPU from full to MIG mode * Dynamic repurposing of a GPU for use as Passthrough vs. vGPU * ... the list goes on ... In this talk, you will learn how to build your own resource driver for DRA. This includes details of how to use Kubernetes's in-tree helper libraries for DRA, where to find an example driver to get you started, as well as best-practices for architecting the driver itself. Throughout this talk, we will use our existing NVIDIA and Intel GPU drivers as a guide, concluding with a demo of these drivers in action.",

While the formal process to go from one stage to the next is written down in the TOC repo, it isn’t just a check the box process and each community will have its own journey. This talk from a current TOC member and maintainer of a project applying for graduation will break down, from both sides of the table, what it takes to build a successful project and community to finally cross the chasm to graduation. The audience will learn: 1. What the graduation process looks like 2. When you should get started with the process 3. How to prepare for each of the graduation requirements 4. What resources are available to projects getting ready for graduation",

Realtime video game servers are one of these things, as a group of friends would not enjoy being booted out of their 30 minute match because the pod they were playing in got autoscaled. At PlayStation we're trying to use an open source project, Agones, to run game servers in a Kubernetes cluster.

In both cases, GitOps is the way to go. As one of the best-known GitOps operators, Argo CD is a popular choice among cluster administrators, but many application developers’ specific features might be standing in the way rather than helping. There is no need to fight with the tool since you can get precisely what you need instead. You don’t have to configure multi-tenancy and SSO integration if you don’t benefit from it. In this presentation, we will describe Argo CD Core - the officially supported Argo CD distribution that includes only the core features and is tailored towards cluster administrator use cases. The presentation covers the main Argo CD Core features and describes how you can combine them with ApplicationSet to get an efficient and flexible Kubernetes cluster management solution.",

Kata-CC is an extension of Kata Containers that makes use of Trusted Execution Environment features present in modern CPUs to enhance security in a multi-tenant environment by combining workload attestation and memory encryption. An issue hindering wider adoption of this technology for some time has been hardware availability. New developments which will be covered in this talk address this and make confidentiality more accessible than ever. Jeremi will talk about the available ways to deploy containers in SEV-SNP (secure encrypted virtualization - secure nested paging) protected confidential virtual machines and dig into their respective architectures.

      "description": "When we write load testing scripts against our applications, we write them sequentially: A, then B, then C. But this doesn't accurately reflect the organized chaos of a system in production, nor does it prepare the system for the unexpected. Emergence is a phenomenon where parts of a whole independently develop properties not originally present in the whole. Emergence is what helps ant workers develop roles without leadership, prompts animals to evolve adaptive traits without forethought, and facilitates non-toxic communities without moderators. The growing field of emergent software applies this swarm logic to the programs that we write. What would it take to write emergent load testing scripts? It turns out that there are a few ingredients for emergence: a large population size, opportunities to interact, feedback, and an element of control. In this talk, Nicole van der Hoeven discusses how to bring these elements to load testing by writing a script in Grafana k6 that can independently decide what requests to make next, modify Kubernetes app pods, and disrupt services based on a continual feed of results during runtime-- all without manual intervention. She shows how to wield this new breed of load testing to improve confidence in the complex systems we build.",

      "description": "For generations, secrets have been kept, shared, and exposed. Most would agree that the best-kept secrets are the ones we've never heard of or told others about. The concepts that revolve around maintaining safe secrets are universal and stem from addressing these questions: \"Where is the secret kept?\", \"Who needs to know about the secret?\", \"How does the secret get shared with the relevant parties?\", and \"How do you prevent the secret from being easily interpreted?\" The answers can help you create a secure lifecycle for storing, sharing, and consuming secrets. In Kubernetes, a secure secret strategy depends on the answers to these same questions. Now more than ever, the vulnerabilities around the storage, sharing, and consumption of secrets in Kubernetes are well known, and as a result, more likely to be exploited. In this talk, Lukonde Mwila will share why addressing these questions can optimize managing sensitive data in Kubernetes. In addition, he'll highlight details of a Kubernetes secret strategy from a real-world project in relation to these questions. Lastly, he'll share how answers to these questions can be used to develop a framework for a secure secret lifecycle in Kubernetes environments with a demo using ESO, ArgoCD, and OPA Gatekeeper.",

We will start off the tutorial by introducing you to Wasm and its system interface (i.e., WASI), and how they work together with the underlying operating system. Then, we will move to demos and hands-on exercises to help you write your very first Wasm service that can, for example, serve HTTP/gRPC requests, persist data to key-value/blob stores, or react to event streams using pub/sub. What's more, these Wasm applications can be authored in multiple programming languages and frameworks, so its content and business logic can be extended to whatever you are most comfortable writing in. All in all, after building applications to Wasm, we will show how to package Wasm components to containers, and, lastly, we will deploy our work to environments like on-prem, cloud, and hybrid cloud using Kubernetes. Overall, you will leave the room having learned the pros and cons of using Wasm and how to build production-ready Wasm applications.",

      "description": "Last year, Felix was handed a Kubernetes cluster and he was told that some pods are using too much memory. He didn't have a single clue about Kubernetes but quickly figured out that pods can be tamed by setting resource limits. Felix went and set limits—and watched the entire cluster go haywire. Half of the pods were stuck in a crash loop, the other half were forever \"pending\". On first sight, resource request and limit seem straightforward: A request is a lower bound for CPU or memory; a limit is an upper bound for CPU or memory. Once demand becomes higher than supply though, it is imperative to know how Kubernetes handles scarce resources. How do these settings influence scheduling? Which pod gets terminated first? Felix learned these things the hard way. He is giving this talk so you don't have to repeat his mistakes.",

      "description": "Open Source communities operate on a set of values that include a commitment to inclusion and diversity. The idea that the tech ecosystem at large is faced with the challenges of diversity and inclusion is not a myth. To some degree, everyone has implicit biases and beliefs about various social and identity groups. Implicit biases are unconscious attitudes or stereotypes that affect how we think, act, and make decisions. Studies have shown that implicit bias is the main cause of most of the problems caused by diversity and inclusion. As users, maintainers, and contributors of Open Source software, we may have encountered different marginalised groups that have shared their encounters of bias in Open Source communities. Majority of people are unaware of this bias and how it affects them as individuals or even as the victims. I'll go over what diversity and inclusion are in this session and why they're important in open source. Challenges faced by underrepresented groups in open source communities as a result of bias. What implicit bias is and how to spot it. Highlights of different forms of implicit bias, how to be more aware of this biases as a community and how it can be improved.",

However, what started as the choreography of common deployment patterns has inevitably grown into a monolith of edge cases. Fortunately, the operator pattern and the extensibility of the Kube API has provided us with the fabric needed to retool. In this talk, Jesse and Greg will show that by providing a framework for declarative API design, we can unlock our platform engineer’s potential. That we can enable our globally distributed teams to build loosely coupled capability primitives on independent release schedules and product roadmaps. They will detail Autodesk's work with Crossplane and KubeVela and how they enable platform teams to build value without reinventing the wheel. Additionally, they will show how the prescription offered by these tools enables the clients of the platform to contribute back through inner source safely, abiding the “rules of the road”. Finally, they will demo how compliance is empowered through admission control and the strong separation of concerns built on Crossplane’s compositions and XRDs in conjunction with K8s RBAC to enforce sane defaults and security non-negotiables.",

      "description": "Many things can go wrong in a distributed system, making conventional testing techniques ineffective in preventing serious and subtle bugs. Even for mature systems like etcd, built on the reliable Raft foundations, bugs are inevitable. Last year the etcd community discovered 4 critical issues including data inconsistencies and lost durability that managed to pass our tests and a rigorous code review. Unfortunately, the testing methodology used by the etcd project was insufficient to detect such problems. So to prevent such issues in the future we needed a new approach. Over the course of 6 months the etcd community built a new testing framework that retroactively detected all issues that were found manually and on top of that identified a new issue. This presentation will discuss how the etcd project has adopted model testing methodology to weed out data inconsistency bugs in etcd and prevent such issues in the future.",

For those new or unfamiliar to monitoring and observability, it can be appealing to just ‘roll the defaults’ from a configuration perspective. However, leaving those defaults unexamined can lead to unexpected performance issues; and worse, potential data loss. In this talk, we walk through the basic structure of the PLG-stack (Promtail, Loki and Grafana). We explore some unexpected cardinality (and associated performance) impacts that arise from the default configurations and how we made thoughtful adjustments to address those impacts.

Search is a fundamental component of an ecommerce platform and high availability is an important requirement for it. While Kubernetes has proven to be the perfect platform for deploying stateless applications, running stateful applications on this platform in a highly available and scalable manner can be complicated. This talk will discuss these challenges and will share the steps towards solving them. For example, Leila will explain the obstacles of implementing storage autoscaling and how using the existing Kubernetes features allowed seamless expansion of persistent disks that store critical search data. She will also explain how her team implemented a feature that allowed shrinking persistent disks without any data loss and saved costs by releasing unused storage. Leila will also explain how Envoy is used to allow clients to connect to Elasticsearch through Kubernetes' ingress.

GPU scheduling in Kubernetes has been limited until now. Not being able to easily share access to single GPUs by multiple workloads leads to inefficiencies when those are light or spiky. At the same time these resources are scarce, expensive and in high demand. In this talk we explore the different possibilities to improve overall usage of GPU resources. We explore the multiple options for GPU scheduling, time sharing and the recently introduced Nvidia Multi-Instance-GPU (MIG) for physical partitioning. We cover the features and limitations of each option and present extensive benchmark results that helped us assign each workload to the most appropriate layout. Finally we describe how we manage GPUs in a centralized way, ensuring optimal resource utilization for services like continuous integration, machine learning and batch.",

In this talk I'd like to dive into why an IBOM (infrastructure bill of materials) is equally important with cloud native infrastructure ultimately being software defined and driven, and how no SBOM is complete without a full inventory of your infrastructure stacks. We'll walk into the tools that will enable you to get an equivalent understanding of what is happening in your cloud native infrastructure including which assets, packages and applications are running where - and how this is all only possible with end-to-end codification. We'll review why this matters from a security perspective - from your service dependencies, to IAM roles, security groups, and even misconfigurations to ensure your infrastructure is properly provisioned and continuously monitored. We'll wrap up with how to leverage your IBOM not only for cost optimization, but also for removing cloud clutter, to reduce your potential attack service.",

      "description": "GitHub actions have been one of the most popular ways to build and release software, with recent developments in supply chain security it became a major target for malicious attacks. A couple of years ago a widespread hack to codecov, a popular service prevalent in build pipelines, caught the industry’s attention. In response, a new solution to protect the build pipeline was created on top of Tracee, OSS Runtime Security solution, and introduced the concept of profiling with eBPF and verifying software builds. In this talk, we will present that solution and explore the lessons learned in the past two years since the initial release.",

As burnout continues to be a growing issue across roles, industries and communities, losing maintainers within small communities can have detrimental impact on the sustainability of that project. This talk will discuss methods and metrics to identify signals for overloaded and overworked maintainers. While metrics alone cannot fix the problem, they can help to proactively flag emerging issues so your community can adjust before it's too late.",

With External Secrets Operator you can leverage existing solutions like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager that manage secrets for you and integrate them with Kubernetes. Moritz and Lucas want to share their insights on how secrets management is done right in a highly regulated environment to hit the sweet spot between developer productivity and information security concerns. In this session, attendees will learn how to manage secrets in a GitOps way for self-sufficient teams to make developers, auditors and product managers happy, going over a few threat models, and showing what should be a target for concern, and should not. External Secrets Operator is a community endeavor that emerged from different open source projects that all tried to solve one problem: pull secrets from a secret management API into Kubernetes. We joined our efforts in 2020 to find a common denominator across projects to build the best solution to that problem and even go beyond that. Today, we've built a vendor-neutral community around the project and provide a consistent custom resource API across different cloud vendors and secret management APIs.",

Storage, networking, container runtimes and most recently cloud-providers are now independently developed in their own projects and repositories. Broadly, we’ve completed the technical code separation: mission accomplished. But have we made kubernetes harder to install, upgrade and operate? Do we still have the quality we had when there was one version of kubernetes, that was end-to-end tested on multiple clouds on every PR? Must a production-ready kubernetes distribution undo all our hard work and reassemble the monorepo? Join two kOps maintainers as they describe how kOps has tackled these issues - by necessity of maintaining a working kubernetes distribution. Learn how kOps maintainers collaborate with these new projects to help them build towards a coherent kubernetes. The speakers will share their visions of the component-based kubernetes distribution that we are all building, and open a discussion on how we should best build and test it. This won’t happen accidentally; the organizational work is at least as hard as the technical work. But together we can build a reliable and easy kubernetes experience, while allowing more choice and experimentation.",

So, is Service Mesh a silver bullet for any complex Observability requirements? No, it isn't - in fact, it can actually make things more complicated. Ryota has been running Istio since its v1.1 release in production. He will share how Istio helped in many areas, and also highlight some parts that he had trouble with, such as cross-cluster trace and metrics. We will then take a step back with Prometheus basics, understand what Istio does by default, and find the gaps.

Security Observability in general is about providing more context into events involving an incident. However, researching those events does not have to be confusing or difficult. In this session, we will help overcome these doubts by learning more about a good kind of S.O.R.E.ness - the Security Observability and Runtime Enforcement kind! In four steps we will: 1.

But then, you run into an error. You Google it. You find similar queries, but never the answer. You pour over the code. You search for anything documenting this project, but keep coming up empty. This project would be perfect, but no one ever documented it. Far too often, the information we need is never found. It stays locked in the minds of the engineers who wrote the code. But what good is code that no one knows how to use? Documentation is every bit as important as making sure the project works. That buy-in can be hard. Stakeholders don’t want to pay for the time. Project managers don’t prioritize the work. Engineers don’t want to do it. The only way to solve this problem is to create a culture around documentation. In this session, we’ll talk about how to elevate the status of the humble documentation to its rightful place alongside your code. We’ll cover how to integrate the documentation process into your existing processes so that your engineers are on board, and how to show stakeholders and others who push back that documentation is not only worthwhile, but essential to the success of your project.",

This talk will cover some important use cases for multi-cluster routing, including examples of how multi-cluster routing can improve the availability of your application. They will demonstrate how to achieve high availability on your applications using multiple clusters, showing how failover from one cluster to another can work. Finally, they will put the pieces together to show end to end demos of multi-cluster routing using the same Gateway API and MultiCluster Service configuration. You will see how these APIs can be used to provide portable multi-cluster routing configuration, even when they are mapped to different underlying cloud infrastructure. They will show how advanced features of Gateway API can be combined with the multi-cluster capabilities of the Multi-Cluster Services API.",

We will then discuss various exposure types and strategies for securing your workloads. Applying this theoretical knowledge to the real world, we will explore how observability tools Cilium, Hubble, and Grafana provide you with Network Policy superpowers, like showing how ingress and egress connections are visualized, enabling you to configure the Network Policies using the Network Policy editor.

In the past 8 years, we’ve seen technical innovation in cloud native garden grow by leaps and bounds. However, with each technical innovation we compact the depths of knowledge that were necessary for that innovation to occur. Kubernetes exists to orchestrate containerized workloads, we use a service mesh like Linkerd or Istio to simplify and secure communications between containerized microservices. Every project in the landscape is designed to create a layer or layers of abstraction to simplify the complexity in cloud native architectures. When compacted and concentrated this information forms knowledge glaciers — an accumulation and compaction of deep knowledge built over time that provides foundational understanding as community knowledge expands. Unless we take steps to preserve and transfer information, the more knowledge we lose with each generation of technologists as those lessons learned (like surviving day two operations) are lost to history. This emphasizes the importance in active succession planning and building-the-bench of community leaders and maintainers. We need to dedicate time to save the glaciers, transfer institutional and technical knowledge within the ecosystem, plant the seeds of tomorrow’s leaders, and make room for our community to grow and bloom.",

We'll go through the challenges we faced with our initial setup while scaling the platform, and our reasons for writing our own operator, instead of relying on existing solutions. We'll explain our platform's conventions, and how we are using OpenAPI as a central point of entry for our APIs. And we'll detail the features we needed - and implemented - to automatically configure our API Gateway based on the OpenAPI documents provided by the different services. While doing so, we'll also relate some organizational challenges, such as switching responsibilities, as well as technical benefits from using the controller pattern: the reconciliation loop, dry-run - with server-side apply. And we'll highlight what we learned along the way. Our technical stack is based on Kong, Kubebuilder/controller-runtime, testcontainers, Kind, Telepresence...",

And yet – a majority of people are using at least 20 operators according to the 2022 Data on Kubernetes Report. For those evaluating their options, the challenge is further complicated by choice; the number of operators continues to grow with Operator Hub currently listing 270+. Without operator standards, how can end users possibly evaluate each one to know whether it meets their needs? This panel unites the Data on Kubernetes Community Operator SIG and Kubernetes Storage SIG to discuss key features of Kubernetes database operators -- what works, what doesn’t, and where the industry is going. Panelists will also present a feature matrix to help end users compare a multitude of database operators.",

      "description": "In the past couple of years supply chain security rose to mainstream attention and the industry has been devoted to address related concerns. Managing vulnerabilities and software dependencies is an integral part of this process. One of the most dominant advancements was the popularization of standard SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials) as well as signed attestations. While SBOM generation and validation is a non-issue today, efficiently utilizing it at scale is still a challenge. It relies on custom solutions or proprietary integrations. OCI artifacts specification is a new specification, which solves this challenge in an elegant and efficient manner. With it, you can sign images, store and sign SBOMs, scan results and other important supply chain related attestations alongside the relevant artifacts in the registry. In this talk, the audience will learn how to improve their vulnerability management practices by employing the new registry capabilities and using open-source tools like Trivy, Notary and ORAS. Same practices could be utilized for any OCI artifact including WASM, packages, and libraries.",

Putting a service mesh into production might require rolling your own CA, for example, but there are other use cases where a private PKI makes sense to avoid the headaches of rate limits, issuance costs or relying on third party services. Luckily for us, the concepts behind Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) have been around since at least the 70s and there are there's a tonne to learn from existing PKI deployments which we can apply to today's cloud native landscape. Plus, cert-manager is here to help! In this talk we'll discuss how to use cert-manager to safely deploy a private PKI at organizational scale and some the things we need to think about to ensure that we can run it safely - without causing a major outage down the road by failing to plan for rotation!

      "description": "Before containers took over the world, a VM was the atomic unit that we used for firewalls, for load balancers and for auto-scaling. Today, some tools and cloud provider services are still centered around VMs, like load balancers that mostly support forwarding traffic to VMs, creating an additional challenge to adopt containers. So, what do you do when you need to configure the cloud load balancer to forward traffic to VMs, but you don’t know on which VMs your container will be running? Or how do you limit connectivity between two apps, if your firewalls rules limit connectivity between VMs and you don’t know on which VM your container will be scheduled? Is all your previous knowledge obsolete now? What new security measures do you need to implement when doing the switch? During this talk we will guide you through the paradigm changes you need to accept to successfully migrate to containers and let go of VMs. Based on our experience of doing this for several companies, we will go through the biggest challenges a cluster administrator faces when migrating to containers in the cloud, including load-balancing, managing firewalls, autoscaling while running them securely.

They onboarded new concepts, rethought deployment automation flows and got creative in the process, when community resources proved insufficient. They migrated off of Spinnaker and rebuilt deployment pipelines from scratch using the Argo projects. In the process, they had to tackle challenges such as promotion of code across environments, automated rollbacks or deployment validation through functional tests. Over time, they refactored these deployment pipelines to serve an increasing number of applications, adding new patterns to accommodate web, streaming and batch services alike. New practices have emerged from this experience, tackling challenges such as: * testing infrastructure changes; * eliminating duplication of manifests; * auditing; * getting visibility into deployments. This journey has left Larisa and Ionut feeling like they're getting GitOps right and that these patterns and practices are ready for company-wide adoption.

This talk provides a fresh view of Knative. Forget about Serverless, consider Knative simply as an Opinionated Kubernetes. Knative advantages include Automation, Simplification, Auto-Scaling, Controlled-Revisions, and An Application Backbone. Deploying services via Knative is therefore a better choice than deploying the same services using Kubernetes directly. Knative requires each deployed service to work in a certain way. We show that many existing microservices are already built to run as Knative services offering an immediate benefit to users. Since Knative extends Kubernetes, it allows a mix and match between Knative services and Kubernetes microservices. We analyze the security benefits of deploying your services via Knative and show how Knative help protect users against configuration drift. We also show that even when users deploy vulnerable services, Knative protects such services from being exploited. Last, we show how using Knative reduces the energy footprint of your services and discuss what the future holds to continuing on this path of making Kubernetes energy efficient.",

In this panel discussion, we will hear from representatives for ARM, Civo, CoreWeave, Killercoda, and NVIDIA. This will be a free-flowing conversation but we expect attendees will learn about how these companies deploy KubeVirt, and any other CNCF projects, to cover their use cases and address their customers' needs, how they interact with and contribute back to the project, and how we can learn from and grow with each other.",

      "description": "Join us for a practical talk on how the Dapr event-driven runtime implements dynamic extensions with WebAssembly. We'll cover how things work in general as well rationale and a peek into implementation. When you leave, you'll have a good idea of how WebAssembly lets you extend cloud native architecture without RPC. Dapr allows custom processing pipelines to be defined by chaining a series of middleware components. A request goes through all defined middleware components before it’s routed to user code, and backwards through the same components before a response is returned to the client. This talk shows how custom HTTP middleware can used without changing the Dapr binary, using WebAssembly technology. Dapr loads these dynamically and without requiring any system dependencies or RPC services. Specifically, we'll review the http-wasm application binary interface (ABI) which SDKs implements, and how this relates to other ABI like proxy-wasm or waPC. Well cover how the middleware works, including the wazero runtime which Dapr embeds to run wasm without system dependencies. Finally, we'll chat about how this fits into Dapr's long-term strategy in extensibility.",

One example is Prometheus, which is the graduated monitoring project in the CNCF. However, monitoring can become a complementary defensive tool for other projects like Falco. Its access via metrics to other kinds of information that is not available in the kernel calls and the ability to look back in the past, allows Prometheus to cover some blindspots that can be exploited by potential attackers. In this talk, David and Mirco will explore some interesting use cases and practical examples where Prometheus can be used for defensive monitoring, giving some ready to use examples and comparing the pros and cons of this approach with runtime security.",

Moving to the cloud for testing is a no-brainer, but how do you synchronize your local changes against your remote Kubernetes environment? Following the usual container build-push-test cycle makes your inner development loop slower because you’d have to wait for minutes, sometimes hours, before seeing the impact of your code changes, and this dramatically reduces the number of iterations you can perform, the features you can ship to your end-users and negatively impacts the developer experience. Using three companies as a case study, this talk highlights how adopting the open source CNCF tool Telepresence improved their developer experience, accelerated their inner dev loop, and reduced staging environment compute costs. An explanation of what Telepresence is and a demo of how to implement it will also be covered in this talk.",

This unlocked a lot of performance potential, while being a mostly drop-in replacement. As our fleet grew and the on-call burden started to rear its head, we did some requirements gathering for running these databases using our new Kubernetes-based platform. We ended up testing a parallel track using several open source technologies. Months into the testing there was a very clear winner which met our requirements: Vitess. We spent the last few months of the year building a proof of concept for one of our smaller services, and launched it with that year’s major titles. The success of this spurred an increased interest in Vitess across Demonware/Activision leading to many larger services adopting it for the following year. This talk will mainly be about the transitional phases of moving from our classic database stack to Vitess. We will give a high level overview of the experience, what we learned, and some interesting points worth sharing to the wider community.",

However, with adoption comes the growing pains of scale: running and managing multiple clusters across different cloud providers represents a major hurdle for organizations wanting to adopt Kubernetes as a standard deployment platform. In particular, observability and security at scale are two thorny aspects that need to be addressed; we will demonstrate how it’s possible to tame the complexity of such scaled infrastructure via open-source tools, such as ClusterAPI, ArgoCD and Prometheus+Thanos to provide control and visibility over an arbitrary number of clusters. We will show a sample, created after our collective experience at large scale customers, which can automate the deployment of hundreds of clusters and applications automatically and securely, and collect metrics from all the ephemeral clusters along the way.",

      "description": "With the increase in K8s and cloud popularity, cloud security providers (CSPs) realized the advantages of offering Kubernetes as a PaaS to their users. Today the default deployment of production workloads is through the cloud-managed Kubernetes services, where the responsibility for securing the cluster is shared between the user and the CSP. While users are generally aware of their own workloads, there is a less-documented set of components, automatically deployed by the CSPs and running on worker nodes. We call it Managed Cluster Middleware (abbreviated MCM). A freshly deployed EKS node will typically have 3 additional pods, AKS and GKE deploy even more pods. The number increases depending on the features and plugins one chooses to add to the defaults. MCM can introduce an additional threat surface, with a footprint on every node and carrying high privileges, additional network exposure and vulnerabilities. Therefore, MCM can be an attractive target for attackers, while frequently omitted by scanners and configuration tools. This talk follows up on our previous research on cloud grey zone. We analyze the MCM security posture as we would approach the non-trusted deployments. Consequently, we review how users should adjust their K8s threat model in light of this research.",

      "description": "The recent prevalance of software supply chain attacks has led to a flurry of new tools and approaches to secure the end-to-end integrity of container images, and image signing in open source is gradually reaching maturity through projects like SigStore. However, the path is largely uncharted for signing and verifying container images internally at scale. Internally, Datadog's engineering teams use a wide variety of languages and CI/CD configurations, constantly deploying images to tens of thousands of nodes across dozens of Kubernetes clusters, spanning multiple cloud providers and datacenters. To meet the challenges of this complex environment, we take a unique approach to image signing and verification. To ease adoption and maintenance of image signing across heterogenous build environments, we take a service-oriented approach, encapsulating cryptographic complexity within a gRPC signing service. For verification, motivated by both reliability and security, we buck the trend of using Kubernetes admission controllers, validating image signatures at runtime using an image verification plugin system we are contributing upstream to containerd. In this talk we discuss how we reached these designs, and share our experience operating this system in production.",

      "description": "Many organizations run Kubernetes as part of managed offerings such as AWS EKS, Azure AKS or GCP GKE. But that’s only one part of the story; other pieces of infrastructure such as databases, object storage or legacy workloads generally live outside the cluster. In this context comes the need to bridge the gaps between what runs inside a managed Kubernetes cluster, and what is deployed in other services of the cloud provider. In this talk, we start by reviewing how the different cloud providers tackle authenticating and authorizing humans to the managed Kubernetes control plane, as well as individual workloads to the cloud provider API. Then, we dive into the different techniques to bring external secrets (e.g., from AWS Secrets Manager) inside the cluster. Along the way we cover how practitioners can leverage these mechanisms to architect cloud-native applications that benefit from the full power of cloud services, while avoiding complete vendor lock-in. We also describe how an attacker can abuse these mechanisms to pivot from exploiting a single containerized workload to compromising full cloud environments, and how to best protect against these attack vectors.",

Yet they used to have to jump through complex hurdles to develop and deploy their code to production. They had to share testing clusters, solve a myriad of puzzles to set up local environments, and request multiple teams to gain access to the deployment environments. This clearly bruised their developer experience and hampered their velocity. Faith in their code dwindled as they played Hunger Games with other developers, and that made their testing experience miserable. Our platform team decided to take the action and implemented a solution using open source tools, including Kubernetes and DevSpace. We were able to create a safe space for our developers to test and rapidly improve their developer productivity.

Enter OPA conftest. OPA conftest allows for policies and testing against structured configuration at the PR level, before any code is merged. By narrowing the scope of allowed declarative permissions, the CICD team at NYT was able to take a \"trust, but verify\" approach to deployment, safeguarding systems while also giving feature developers the autonomy they needed to self-service deploy their applications.

This talk will focus on several key efforts that are currently underway. First, we will show off how in-toto layouts (policies) can be used to verify attestations. Next, we will discuss our efforts to collate attestation types so as to map information captured in different types and their hierarchy. Finally, we will present a recap of other activities in the in-toto project like changes to implementations, usability enhancements, updates to integrations with systems mentioned above, and more!",

      "description": "Ingress controllers have historically used custom annotations or implementation-specific mechanisms to express advanced features like rate limiting, authN, authZ, and others. This means common features of different projects are configured in a myriad of ways, leaving cluster operators and application developers with a headache when choosing an implementation or migrating between them. Gateway API strives to express traffic routing and other core features in a standardized manner. The project endeavors to approach extension points and future capabilities of the API in the same way. Gateway API offers standardized mechanisms for implementation-specific configuration and a defined process for contributors to push their work upstream to augment the project’s functionality. In this talk, Daneyon Hansen and Sunjay Bhatia, maintainers of Envoy Gateway and Contour, will detail how Gateway API extension mechanisms work and how they fit into this role-oriented and expressive interface. Different personas in the Gateway API model will learn how extensions can be used to fulfill their needs. Examples from various projects will show how community collaboration within a particular implementation and the upstream Gateway API project works to benefit the whole ecosystem.",

We describe our architecture to achieve high service availability, the options we took to reduce blast radius, the concept of “clusters as cattle” and how extensive use of gitops saved the day. We will also describe some lessons learned in the process, the detected cyclic dependencies when recovering from a major outage, and the corner cases where more care is needed for stateful workloads and multi-cluster scheduling. We will demo this on stage showing how real CERN services recover from what would not so long ago be events with a very serious impact. And how the effort from the last years has paid off, with our users responding calmly and positively while going through a major incident.",

      "description": "If you're running Kubernetes in production, you've probably thought about how to keep your clusters and their workloads in compliance with corporate or regulatory policies. In Kubernetes, you'll probably do this with an admission controller. An admission controller intercepts requests to the Kubernetes API server and allows you to validate or change it. Gatekeeper is an Open Polciy Agent based admission controller that enables enforcement of CRD-based policies. These policies normally act on data within the request or other static data within your cluster. However, sometimes that's not enough. As Software Supply Chain security becomes more important, our policies need to consider more external artifacts. Maybe you want to verify that images are signed or that the SBOM for a service doesn't have that latest OpenSSL CVE. Gatekeeper's external data feature allows you to do just this, through the use of plugin providers. Ratify is an open source project that enables verification of supply chain artifacts and can act provider for Gatekeeper. In this talk, Jeremy will show how to you can use Gatekeeper, Ratify, and OCI registries to develop supply chain security focused policies for your clusters, as well as how to write your own custom verifiers to meet evolving policy requirements.",

      "description": "Interactive debugging has been around for decades. Being able to set breakpoints, watch expressions, and “stepping” through code not only helps investigate bugs, it helps us learn how complex applications work. Debugging an application in Kubernetes is like debugging a remote process, but with more challenges. Container images frequently have executables without debug symbols, and no debugger server executable.The typical Pod does not run a debugger server, and does not expose a port on which a debugger client could connect. The target executable is in a separate mount namespace, and the target process in a separate process namespace. This session will demonstrate how to solve these challenges by using ephemeral containers, and widely-available, open-source tools. Along with these tools, we will use an IDE to simultaneously, interactively debug multiple, cooperating controllers from the Cluster API project.",

Scheduling requirements differ for these different types of workloads. The default scheduler and workload resources, like a job or cronjob, are not always a good fit. Jobs change each run based on the data being processed. Some jobs need a set of pods, or gang, to start processing, but could use more or less. How do we get that flexibility? Pods are often created on the fly by a management pod. Jobs can fail due to pod rejection as part of quota enforcements. Why not queue the pods instead until quota is available? What happens if the management pod get preempted? Using the scheduling framework Apache YuniKorn has extended the scheduler to add batch focussed functionality. All added functionality is opt-in and can be used on top of the existing default functionality. Job aware preemption, gang scheduling and queueing with quotas enforced while scheduling are some of the features we will cover.",

      "description": "CRDs are great! Until they're not. Need an advanced validation rule? You're going to need an admission webhook for that. Oh, and if you want to do multi-version CRDs, good luck, there's another special type of webhook just for that! Once you start using webhooks, your CRD must be bundled with a binary containing all the webhooks plus webhook configuration resources to activate the webhooks. Things get complicated fast. What if we could make all that go away? Imagine if somehow this could all be done declaratively in a single, self contained CRD? Using the CEL expression language in Kubernetes, we added advanced CRD validation rules (Beta in Kubernetes 1.25) and have plans for additional enhancements. Learn about the future of CRDs from a sig-api machinery contributor who helped introduce CEL to Kubernetes. Can CRDs really be made entirely self-contained? What does this mean for extension authors or cluster administrators? Is CEL sufficiently powerful to eliminate the need for webhooks? What features are available now and when are the rest planned?",

What are the aspects that influence power consumption of your machines? What steps can be taken to reduce overall consumption of Kubernetes clusters? Does just using Kubernetes already improve your footprint? In this presentation David and Marco will explore the possibilities throughout the entire hardware and software stack: From bare metal server configuration over power management in the operating system to operating strategies for Kubernetes, many facets will be covered. How independently can the various measures be implemented? How do they interact with each other? How will this impact performance?

Having the ability to extend its functionality using filters allow developers to implement many custom features. With WebAssembly and ProxyWasm, you can create filters using languages like Go, Rust, and Zig. All mentioned languages are compiled ones. What if you can extend it even more? What if you can use the same interpreted language that powers your backend? In this case, you can reuse your knowledge to create these filters. You don't need to learn a new language to write a filter for Istio. This flexibility simplifies the development process and ensures any team can build its filters.

These technologies are relevant across diverse cloud native projects and parts of the technology stack ranging from networking to application monitoring and from security to storage. Yet this space is still evolving and knowledge about good development practices is highly scattered and uncommon. Most educational content in this space focusses on the \"What is eBPF\" question and very little if any goes to the next step of documenting best practices and guidelines for an entire team to build production ready cloud native eBPF software projects. In this talk we provide some guidelines for dev and ops teams to build and deploy production ready cloud native applications that use eBPF technology. We cover available programming models, tool chains and their pros and cons, understanding portability and maintainability across multiple kernel versions and execution environments and designing for operational requirements. We will then provide demos and code walkthrough of sample eBPF programs that illustrate the use of some of these best practice recommendations. The audience will leave with a good understanding of best practices for teams building the many cloud native projects that use eBPF technology.",

      "description": "This is a real life story of how our company had an operational incident caused by misconfiguration and the most reliable way to get everything working again was to rebuild our entire cluster from scratch. This was only possible because of the investments we had made into GitOps, ArgoCD, kOps and keeping our infrastructure as code. Out of nowhere our cluster was failing in a way we had never seen before. Our standard backup and recovery methods were not working, etcd was inaccessible, customers were down. Our last card was to recreate the entire cluster and re-install all our services. We had practiced it many times but this would be the first real disaster recovery. Would all our planning and migration to GitOps and ArgoCD pay off, could things be brought back to a healthy state? How fast could we do it? In the end we managed to recreate the cluster in 51 minutes and we learned a lot along the way. Many of the tools we invested in did not work as expected, disaster recovery guides were outdated and things we had never planned for occurred. We talk about the workarounds we had to employ, the work we had to do afterwards and how we plan to improve on this in the future (what we learned).",

Kubernetes supports provisioning volumes from a variety of data sources, like PVCs, VolumeSnapshots, and CRDs (beta in Kubernetes 1.24). However, data sources are restricted to exist in the same namespace. Due to this restriction, sharing data between namespaces has been difficult. As a result, use cases like copying volumes from a production namespace to a development namespace for testing and copying golden images in one namespace to other consuming namespaces can't be achieved without administrators' help. To solve this issue, provision of volumes from cross-namespace data sources (KEP-3294) is planned to be supported as alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.26.

      "description": "In this talk the SIG will be covering new features as well as proposed future functionality. New features including the Cluster Autoscaler's snapshotter to assist in cluster debugging. This allows cluster operators to understand the state the CA is using to drive decisions. Proposed future functionality includes: The Multidimensional Pod Autoscaler (MPA): The MPA proposes combining the actions of the Horizontal and Vertical Pod Autoscalers, but separating the actuation from the controlling algorithms. The Balancer API: Balancer is a new resource in the Autoscaling API that may be used as an HPA scale target. It allows autoscaling workloads in which some Pods have a slightly different spec. Use cases include evenly distributing Pods across zones in regional clusters or maintaining a desired ratio between Pods running on differing VMs. Promotion of a number of alpha HPA features. If you're interested in any of these, or want to be involved in implementing them, come along!",

      "description": "How do we build a self-service platform that allows developers self-service of network configuration beyond what we can do with the familiar Ingress and service mesh resources? The increased adoption of GitOps and cloud-native ways of deploying applications increase our need to configure network features that are external to Kubernetes such as multi-cluster and multi cloud/region support but also adaptive traffic filtering, DoS protection etc. However, the possibilities with a Kubernetes API driven approach are limited. This forces developers into the Terraform domain and alternative workflows, which increases cognitive load. In this talk TV 2 Denmark will share their experience building a Kubernetes API-driven self-service platform for managing cloud network infrastructure. The platform builds on a Kubernetes controller-of-controllers that implements the Gateway API and realizes network infrastructure through cloud-provider agnostic integrations using Crossplane and Istio.",

Unfortunately there are a lot of things that can go wrong when managing the nodes: nodes failing to boot up, hitting a resource quota, provider running out of capacity, misconfigured pod blocking scale-down and running up the bill, the list goes on. Some of those problems Cluster Autoscaler may be able to handle for you while others may require manual intervention. Maciek has been part of the GKE team running tens of thousands of instances of Cluster Autoscaler for many years. He will share some of his experiences, covering: *What metrics are useful for monitoring Cluster Autoscaler in a single cluster or across a small fleet of clusters. * How to use metrics to quickly identify common issues. * When to look into logs and how to read them. * What are the most common types of issues faced by Cluster Autoscaler issues and which configurations should be avoided. During the talk Maciek will focus on issues that are common to running Cluster Autoscaler on any cloud and not specific to any single provider.",

      "description": "In the age of cloud-native applications, \"Zero Trust\" has become a buzzword that often lulls us into a false sense of security. In this thought-provoking and contentious talk, we challenge the conventional wisdom surrounding trust and software security, asserting that trust is a decision made by the observer rather than an intrinsic property of a system. Buckle up as we dive into cloud-native security, revealing its inherent fallacies and misconceptions.We'll begin by debunking the myth of \"trustworthy\" systems, arguing that the observer's perception of trust is based on contextual factors and subjective judgment, not on any inherent trait within the system. We'll provide real-world examples of widely trusted systems that have failed catastrophically and examine the consequences of misplaced trust.Next, we'll explore the implications of this unsettling reality for developers, operators, and businesses. We'll discuss the need for continuous vigilance and validation in our security practices and the importance of embracing a culture of \"reasoning about trust\" in the cloud-native landscape.Finally, we'll offer actionable strategies for managing trust within cloud-native environments. These will include embracing chaos engineering to simulate failures, implementing comprehensive auditing and monitoring practices, and fostering a mindset of skepticism and continuous questioning regarding security.Join us as we pull back the curtain on the unsettling truth of software security and implore you to reconsider your approach to trust in the cloud.",

Cluster certificate authorities need to be rotated in addition to the downstream certificates these cluster CAs sign to implement an access renewal and revocation strategy. Certificates issued by the cluster CA including node kubelet client certificates, node kubelet server certificates, and cluster administrator certificates need to be able to be rotated in a zero downtime fashion in order to maintain availability throughout this revocation process. This talk outlines a strategy that organizations can utilize to rotate cluster CAs with zero downtime using CA cross signing. We will visually walkthrough the workflow and how certificates for individual critical cluster components change throughout the rotation process. We will touch on how cross signing enables this process to occur without any downtime to existing components running within the cluster. We will then touch on how new access can be granted to the cluster once the rotation process is complete.",

      "description": "Gateway API and the MCS API are two pieces of your multicluster traffic management puzzle: Gateway API provides advanced routing capabilities and the MCS API provides cross cluster service discovery. These two Kubernetes native APIs are sponsored by SIG-Network and SIG-Multicluster, respectively. How can these two APIs work together? How have they evolved, separately and as part of a larger upstream initiative to make the multicluster experience feel native? Both APIs are CRD-based, and each SIG focused on standards over details, leaving implementers plenty of room; so how have users dealt with the challenges to discover, install, and maintain synergistic controllers? Finally, where do they fit with the larger ecosystem of service discovery solutions, including service meshes and vendor specific tooling? Another project, the GAMMA initiative, sits smack between all of these, seeking to unify the east-west traffic management puzzle along one coherent, standards-driven direction. Answering these questions and more, join us for a panel style discussion with representatives from the Gateway API project, MCS API project, and GAMMA initiative. Our panelists will speak from their experience both developing the upstream standard and actually implementing the APIs with different vendors.",

In this talk, we'll look back into the starting points and give a comprehensive introduction to the highlight technologies of KubeVela. In general, we'll talk about for parts:1) Balance Extension and User Experience: How to provide an easy-to-use abstraction for end users while allow extension for any Kubernetes API? How to keep the compatiblity when some of Kubernetes API deprecated?2) Powerful Orchestration:  How to allow data passing for application components dependency? How to override parameters for multi-environments delivery? How to define rollout and traffic splitting ways, check metrics with quality gates to make sure the delivery is safe?3) Resource Management: How can we share resources in multiple applications? How can we define the replicas of application at initialization while working with an HPA later? How to define different garbage collection policy for data storage and workload metadata?4) Large Scale and Stability: When the application scales up, How to horizontally scale the controller? Which part of the system will become the bottleneck first? How to improve performance for different scenarios?As maintainers of the project, we have seen a large number of user scenarios including those from Alibaba Cloud and China Merchants Bank, and we will share the highlights over the past three years' experience .",

In order to fully apply the philosophy of ‘never trust, always verify’, we must build systems with a sound understanding of the adversaries who may wish to compromise our data, how such a compromise could occur, and how we can protect ourselves by implementing proportionate, layered security controls. The foundation on which we can construct this ‘secure by design’ approach is threat modeling. In this talk, we will: - introduce the fundamental concepts of threat modeling, and how they can be applied to systems made up of many distributed cloud-native workloads; - demonstrate a simple system built using Zero Trust principles, with workloads running on an Istio service mesh within a Kubernetes cluster; - show how cryptographically strong workload identities can be provided by a SPIRE server; - demonstrate how Istio External Authorization can delegate layer 7 authorization decisions to OPA sidecars; - build our threat model and introduce controls following the Zero Trust philosophy, including a demonstration of custom signing and verification of OPA bundles.",

      "description": "Kubernetes is suitable for stateless services and one of its benefits is seamless autoscaling of infrastructure in response to varying load. The resulting elasticity enables users to optimize their infrastructure and minimize costs. But what do you do if your application is stateful - for example it requires maintaining stateful sessions between clients and servers and you are using a service mesh? In this talk we will cover stateful applications where clients can create and maintain persistent sessions in the presence of load balancing where Istio routes individual RPCs to various backends. Client creates a persistent session and expects all RPCs in that session to go to a particular backend because the backend has the “state” related to that session and is not able to share the state with other backends. Note that consistent hashing or rendezvous load balancing don’t quite work because session persistence is broken when the set of backends changes. The feature uses HTTP Cookies where persistent or stateful sessions are achieved by communicating with the load balancer via cookies in Istio and proxyless gRPC. We also cover the use-case of “draining backends” where backends are gradually removed as part of downsizing the infrastructure but without breaking session persistence.",

      "description": "Building real-world event sourced systems is hard. Building them to run at massive scale in the cloud across multiple pieces of disparate infrastructure is so daunting that many never attempt it. However, leveraging the tiny size, portability, security, and speed of WebAssembly, wasmCloud helps us build distributed systems simply by defining business logic as Wasm modules, and we can extend that even further by adding an event sourcing layer on top. In this session, we will take a look at one of wasmCloud's event sourcing capabilities. We will demonstrate how you can build aggregates, projectors, notifiers, injectors, and process managers all out of simple WebAssembly components, and assemble them into a highly scalable, resilient, distributed application. We'll demonstrate a fully functioning, event sourced system all by showing you how little code you need to write, as well as talk about how Cosmonic is using this same capability to build the backend to its entire platform. Rather than just highlight the easy tasks, this session will tackle tough topics like replays, durable streams, and much more.",

This presentation is no exception. Brian and Kasper will provide insights into how Lunar is building an internal compliance platform using Backstage and paving the paths for developers to be compliant. The value gained from this approach is manyfold when working under extended compliance requirements in the banking industry, such as dynamic documentation, secure and compliant defaults, and much more. Brian and Kasper will highlight a specific use case, detailing how software asset management and classification can be made easy by utilizing the software catalog and built-in models in Backstage. In particular, domain models are useful for Lunar to provide clarity of the entire software catalog and ownership of components. This use case will highlight some of the ways Lunar is embedding compliance throughout the entire development lifecycle, and how we are working with compliance by design that focuses on guaranteed compliance with policies as code.",

While considerable effort and cost were spent on all three pillars of observability (metrics, log, events), there was a gap in identifying customer impact and causal service to improve MTTD/R for our services. The challenge is that we need to analyze massive amounts of data generated by these data sources in real-time at scale, which is a beast of a problem. Our talk focuses on using Numaproj (Intuit’s open project) and other CNCF open-source technologies to address this problem. Numaproj includes Numaflow, a stream processing platform, and Numalogic, a collection of ML models. We will show how we collect, process, and analyze data per minute in real-time and how using Numaproj, we compute normalized anomaly scores for every data point. These anomaly scores helped us weed the noises out from the data, provide a high signal-to-noise ratio, and directly create incidents. Today we detect incidents based on the scores (~98% confidence) generated by our AIOps platform. With this solution, Intuit has established a cookie-cutter to reduce its MTTD from over 30 minutes to less than 3 minutes.",

To make multi-tenancy elastic and resilient, we first refactor region management and TSO service as micro-services, and isolate tenancies according to their scale and QoS.

What can you do if those permissions are required for the container to work?We’ve run multiple de-privileging efforts for production containers. In 2020 we focused on converting containers from running as root to running as unprivileged users. In 2021 we moved containers to minimal distroless images. For some containers the solution was as simple as removing unused permissions. But sometimes we needed to do something more drastic, like charge the design of the container to segment out powerful permissions, or split functionality out into initContainers.

The efficiency of Kubernetes has been shown to reduce cloud costs and carbon footprints, but do these benefits scale down? Due to its complexity, training times for those adopting Kubernetes have an environmental price tag. For smaller companies or individuals, is Kubernetes the most beneficial solution? Do the long term benefits outweigh the initial costs of the learning curve? How does Kubernetes compare to its alternatives from a sustainability perspective? What is its environmental price tag and how can developers minimize their impact? We will be exploring when the Kubernetes adoption journey becomes environmentally productive and visualizing its energy usage scaling from individual contributors to enterprises.",

IPv6 is an important protocol for Kubernetes, because it solves the problem about IP address exhaustion. The project has been working on implementing it for a long time, supporting IPv6 single-stack clusters since its version 1.18, and dual-stack clusters since version 1.23 March 2020. Kubernetes is also an Open Source project, driven by the community, and the development doesn’t follow a strict and well documented process, with architectural decisions and implementation details not being well documented at times. However, the project is very serious abouts its APIs, with a strong commitment to not breaking compatibility. This allows the project to have a quick feedback loop delivering new features, and allows other projects to have an opportunity to add. During this talk Antonio Ojea, Kubernetes maintainer and developer, and Fernando Gont, author of multiple IETF IPv6 protocol specifications , will do an exhaustive analysis of the Kubernetes IPv6 architecture and take a look “under the hood” to explain the myths, legends and realities of IPv6 in Kubernetes.",

However to run our druid setup on kubernetes we had to solve challenges related to availability, metadata and evolutivity. We will present our architectures (past and present) and the technical means we used to install and manage druid on our clusters with an opensource operator, how we optimize our caching with Memcached and caffeine and how we performed a migration with no downtime and no costly backfills. At the end we will explain how we integrate this setup with our gitops workflow , how we realize common operations (vertical/horizontal scaling, updates, monitoring) and what we are working on as the next step for our Druid stack: Ingestion improvements, multi-tenancy and running Druid without Apache Zookeeper",

It will be explained which have been added recently and how operators can use all of them in 2023. The first important feature is the hash-ring and replication factor that ensures that process crashing can be tolerated. There is also the zone aware replication that helps to tolerate zone outages. No less important are the tenant limits that help to control costs and usage for specific tenants. After that there are also the instance limits that prevent single processes from getting overloaded.

Specifically, the Rook operator provides cloud-native storage to applications, orchestrating the Ceph storage system. Recently, tracing was added to Ceph, using an Open Telemetry client and Jaeger backend. In this talk, we would show how we combine per pod energy consumption data coming from Kepler, together with the tracing information coming from Jaeger to estimate the energy consumption of each user in the storage system, even when the consumption is spread among multiple pods. This solution highlights the feasibility of building sustainable computing futures in the CNCF ecosystems. It will benefit both end users and developers and inspire more innovations.",

      "description": "One might naively think that to deploy a production app on Kubernetes, all one needs is a Kubernetes cluster. Indeed, before going to production, we'll need a Kubernetes cluster, and therefore, we'll need to make a few decisions: on premises or on cloud? Managed or self-hosted? But there is way more to it because our new cluster will almost always require a few additions before being truly production-ready. Even if we choose a state-of-the-art managed cluster from a leading cloud provider, we still need to add something to handle logging and metrics. Supporting Ingress resources or Network Policies can also require extra work; as does managing persistent volumes or inbound traffic when running on premises. Finally, while most of us used commands like \"kubectl run\" or \"kubectl apply\" to run our first Kubernetes containers and workloads, going to production requires a few extra tools to tailor our YAML manifests to various environments (e.g. kustomize, Helm, or Carvel), and automate its deployment (e.g. ArgoCD, Flux). The goal of this talk is to give us a production-readiness checklist. Without being exhaustive, this checklist will bring awareness to the gap that exists between Kubernetes \"cluster\" and \"a *production* cluster\", and give solid leads about how to bridge that gap.",

Many organizations codify allow/deny policies based on the results of these scans, using this policy-as-code approach to form the basis of trust. But what exactly are container scanners looking for? And can you always trust the results? Let’s break this down layer by layer, from an attacker perspective. Why do certain changes in the way images are built produce wildly varying results? Can the flexibility in how container images are built and distributed be used to alter or prevent scanning tools from being able to fully understand what's in a container? How might clever image builders use these tricks to avoid scrutiny from these tools? Join the hacker crew known as SIG-Honk, and let’s have some fun! Ian Coldwater, Duffie Cooley, Brad Geesaman, and Rory McCune will demonstrate some creative ways to intentionally bypass container image analysis and admission control detection. Attendees will walk away with a greater understanding of the limitations of tooling used to validate images, and learn how to create better security policies in their own environments.

It can involve several different parts of the organization, like the infrastructure team, the network planning team, the app operations team, the security team, and more. Just getting the right input from each of those organizations for a single instance of an app can be painful. Now, try to fan that out across 1,000 - or 10,000 - clusters, and you have a \"values\" management nightmare.

      "description": "Load balancers are a critical part of application ingress for Kubernetes clusters. One of the simplest ways of achieving this is creating a Service and specifying the type `LoadBalancer`. Kubernetes applies a simplistic interpretation of the cluster's networking state when configuring the load balancers with the set of nodes to be used as backends. This model introduces some serious failure modes for application ingress when the model becomes decorrelated and is completely orthogonal to the state of the application itself. Load balancers may not have the most up to date node set, go through unnecessary reconfigurations, and blindly route traffic without an application specific healthcheck. Moreover, the current mechanism has also proven to be computationally suboptimal and misses a lot of opportunities for more production-grade approaches such as allowing load balancers to dynamically route application related traffic without the need for reconfiguration. This talk will walk through the current implementation, the existing problems and the proposed north star. Alexander and Swetha will cover how the refactored support will better uphold application SLA.",

Using a demo application we will demonstrate performance and metrics for that application and how the metrics change with increasing request volumes. We will show how metrics change when a new configuration of our application introduces error rates and increases request duration. Finally, we will show how tracing headers for the application can be exported with Hubble HTTP metrics as Exemplars to link metrics to traces in Grafana, monitoring each request and its duration using Tempo.

SLSA (slsa.dev) is seeing increased adoption, both from industry and open source projects. Besides released artifacts, SLSA provenance attestation may also be generated for other types of \"artifacts\", such as vulnerability scanner results, SBOMs, etc. This allows the generation of trustworthy supply-chain metadata about arbitrary artifacts. Implementing a SLSA compliant attestor is, however, hard work, and requires expertise in both SLSA and the underlying platform used to build it. Come to this talk to learn about a recent extension of the SLSA framework that allows you to wrap existing tools (in the form of a binary, a GitHub Action or a container) into a SLSA compliant attestor, with minimal effort. We will show how SLSA builders for several package managers, such as npm and maven, are implemented with this framework. We will also report the lessons learned and the challenges we faced, in the hope it will help others in the field.

But here's a challenge that comes with implementing Pod Security Admission: there's always a workload that needs too many privileges to run, and then it needs to get a pass from the security controls. One way to address this unsecured footprint is to break down all the different services, applications, and packages into their separate component parts, leaving the bits that need privileges privileged, and locking down everything else. There's a whole art to that – we'll talk about it. But 'principle of least privilege' doesn't mean zero privilege so... What do we do when that privilege gets exploited? We welcome it with a node that has nothing valuable whatsoever, is what! And there's a whole art to that too – we'll talk about it.

      "description": "This talk will explore the mental leap from understanding basic Kubernetes abstractions, to understanding how Istio enhances or extends these abstractions with its own. When working with Istio, its sidecar model influences one’s mental model in subtle ways that become more overt over time. It takes two to tango, and Istio’s API are implemented across two interacting sidecars. You get a sense of what happens in “client side” sidecars (like routing decisions), or “server side” sidecars (like authorization policies), and all of a sudden the world starts to make sense. Istio Ambient mesh moves away from the sidecar model, and offers flexibility of when and where to place proxies, at the cost of having to make such decisions. While Istio Ambient Mesh supports the same Istio API primitives, when and where policies are implemented under the hood is completely different. The sidecar tango has evolved into the waypoint waltz, and suddenly your existing mental model gets turned upside down. There’s always an “aha” moment (or maybe even a mind-blowing experience) when a new mental model starts to make sense and everything is good again. We’d like to share our experience getting there with Istio Ambient Mesh, and put you on the path to achieving something similar!",

It has been a revolution since its first release, in 2015, filling the gap in the IT industry for container orchestration and improving the efficiency in software development, experiencing exponential adoption and growth. Long gone are those days that Kubernetes was used only in the Cloud, and it has progressively extended to many areas like the edge and on premises data centers. However, due to rapid adoption, its implementation inside the organizations may not be planned holistically, with different teams implementing different Kubernetes clusters leading to inconsistencies that are operationally difficult to manage. This situation presents a new challenge when these ops teams have to collaborate: How can they connect their Services? How do they communicate their workloads? How do they secure these communications? Multi cloud and hybrid cloud are real problems, in this panel of architects and practitioners, we explore cross-cloud connectivity challenges and share insights on how to solve infrastructure performance, implement golden signals to monitor the disparate cloud environments.",

First, we demonstrate how it simplifies running parallel workloads which require pod-to-pod communication, including distributed machine learning examples based on its use by DeepMind. Next, we demonstrate the orchestration of HPC workloads using the Flux Operator. Here, we create a \"Mini Cluster\" within Kubernetes built on top of an indexed job, providing a rich ecosystem for orchestration of batch workloads, related user interfaces, and APIs. We also discuss the challenge of handling pod failures for long-running workloads. We show how Pod Failure Policy can be used to continue job execution despite numerous pod disruptions (caused by events such as node maintenance or preemption), yet reduce costs by avoiding unnecessary pod retries when there are software bugs.",

However, we dislike drowning in alerts on every metric \u0026 experiencing alert fatigue. The worst consequence of alert fatigue is not just on-call engineer burn out, but on-call snoozing alerts that could prevent incidents. At Intuit, we needed a smarter way to get alerted on a cluster’s Golden Signals, which are picked from an ocean of metrics. This would help reduce the MTTD during incidents. We wanted to achieve this without the burden of instrumenting cluster components. Observability vendors provide solutions using eBPF instrumentation and AI driven insights on prometheus data, but we wanted to explore open source solutions to achieve the same. In this talk, we explain how we explored numalogic, an open source AIOps anomaly detection engine for Kubernetes. You will learn how to use numalogic on Prometheus metrics to derive baseline behaviors and detect anomalies, without any prior AI/ML experience. We will show how we collect, process and analyze in-cluster data in real time and how numalogic computes anomaly scores for each component, which bubbles up a single anomaly score for the cluster.

This means just to be able to function in a modern cloud native system, applications needs to store and use sensitive data constantly - such as passwords, access keys, certificates (among other private keys), and these sensitive keys have become a core part of the code we write. We’ve learned a long time ago that we can’t have hard-coded secrets, and that’s where tools like Vault or practices like environment variables have come into play. When it comes to Kubernetes, most organizations use Kubernetes secrets by default to secure their private keys and data. However, by design and even in the docs it is clearly stated that these are stored unencrypted in the API server’s underlying data store etcd. Because we have learned the hard way that we need to protect our secrets at all costs, we will take a deep dive on the Secret Store CSI Drive. We’ll understand how it works under the hood, and with multiple credential provider support we’ll demonstrate through code examples how the CDI Driver ensures robust security, least privilege access, and integrates seamlessly into code.",
