Users are now developing their own extensions to automate their applications and infrastructure. This emerging practice has been enabled by the growing set of tools designed to make developing these custom APIs easy.Of these tools, Kubebuilder, a Kubernetes sub-project, has been adopted by the Kubernetes project and end-users alike. It serves as a framework for rapidly building and publishing Kubernetes APIs by providing simple abstractions and automation for the common components involved with a controller.Attendees will learn how to approach development using best practices and methodologies for building Kubernetes Controllers.

To minimize race conditions, and other side effects of distributability, applications are often deployed with a replica count limited one or use primitives like StatefulSet to influence pod scheduling stickiness. Unfortunately, these are not enough to create truly distributed applications that can gracefully react to changes in their environment at runtime. While the controller and operator patterns have helped, they tend to use raw API primitives that are not related to building distributed systems.  This presentation is a discussion that presents the features needed to create truly distributed applications that can react to changes in a distributed environment and including features such as leader election, synchronization, and coordination.\n",

Our microservices should be as close to pure business logic as possible, but what happens when we add so many services that our network requests are dramatically slowing the application down? The natural result is to look for some caching of requests on either the client or service side. Enter Redis, Memcached, and other caching tools all to help reduce network calls and overall latency. All of this comes with implementation penalty reducing the purity of our services. We will demonstrate how Istio's Mixer component can be used to cache requests at the request level and how that can keep your application fast, without ruining the purity of your services.\n",

For example, liveness probes could catch a deadlock, where an application is running, but unable to make progress. Restarting the Container in such a state can help to make the application more available despite bugs. When a Container is starting, the kubelet has no way to tell whether the startup is deadlocked or just taking longer than expected. This is problematic when deploying Java based application servers which can take several minutes to start.

      "description": "\n  This time last year, two people from Wales, United Kingdom decried to bring the CNCF to their doorstep.  Previously, they were attending international conferences and national meetups to meet and be a part of the community.  Knowing that they were in a privileged position, they wanted to share it with others that, for whatever reason, were unable to make these events.  Cloud Native Wales will be soon celebrating a year of meetups, and best of all, we get to share this with the 100's of people within our meetup community.  This talk will inspire you to take the chance to branch the CNCF and build a community closer to home, help others learn, share and contribute to the world wide community.\n",

This is disproportionate to the 20% prevalence in the general population. To compound the concern, many working in the tech community are at risk for burnout, a condition that often resembles mental illness. While lots of people in tech struggle with mental health, industry-specific research and advocacy in the community is disproportionately inadequate.For organizations, awareness and advocacy around employee mental health is crucial, after all, happy employees are more productive and less likely to leave their job. For employees who are struggling, it is important they know that they are not alone and there is help. This talk is focused on reducing the stigma around mental illness and expanding education and awareness into how to help yourself and others in your community. Jennifer will provide mental health background as she reviews the research pertaining to the tech community. Industry-specific burnout will be discussed and strategies for improving one’s experience or helping a friend or colleague will be examined.Participants will learn concrete steps for improving mental health in the workplace at an organizational, team, and individual level.\n",

These set of resources can be divided in NetworkingPerformanceTest, NetworkingDebuggingTest, NetworkSimulationTest all under the NetworkMachinery group.  Finally, the resources might utilize common network knowledge and even some dark-art tooling (e.g. OpenFlow, OVS, OVN) to provide more insight on the network\n",

      "description": "\n  This is an introduction to the Kubernetes Service Catalog project. Service Catalog lets you provision cloud services, regardless of where they are hosted, directly from the comfort of native Kubernetes tooling. This works across platforms because we follow the Open Service Broker API, an open standard to provision and manage cloud services. Learn how you can use Service Catalog to access third-party services from your Kubernetes applications. We will walk through provisioning a database directly through Kubernetes and and then connect to it from an application running on the cluster.\n",

Services have evolved over time to span multiple clusters as well as hybrid deployments that encompass both on-prem and multiple clouds. There are several use cases for multiple Kubernetes clusters: canarying new versions of your app, or low latency access for your users across the globe.   In this session, we will present a new version of the Ingress and the Service APIs. These API’s form the foundational blocks for managing your global, scalable and reliable services close to your users using a single control plane. Moreover, we will compare these new API’s with different models for spreading services across multiple cluster (e.g Istio). We will demo a custom controller we have written that will configure multi-cluster HTTP(S) load balancing given these new API’s.\n",

In an effort to prevent snowflake clusters, we provided a base set of services for logging, monitoring, etc.; however, application teams inevitably want to customize their logging solution or add a monitoring dashboard. We realized this mix of standard and optional services could quickly get out of control and needed normalization. In early 2018, we exposed application teams to Kubernetes manifests; they were excited about control over deployments, but unprepared for the complexity. By late 2018, we needed to minimize complexity and find a way to express high-level application needs, while providing secure, scalable and redundant deployments. This is our journey of how we embraced GitOps, and the challenges we faced making deployment descriptions minimalistic.\n",

      "description": "\n  Network Service Mesh (NSM) is a novel approach solving L2/L3 network use cases in Kubernetes that are tricky to address with the existing Kubernetes Network Model. Inspired by Istio, Network Service Mesh maps the concept of a service mesh to L2/L3 payloads.Network Service Mesh enables a variety of types of Use Cases such as:* Connecting Pods to:-VPN Gateways-Non-Kubernetes virtual bridge domains-The *right* physical NIC or SR-IOV VF for their needs-Multiple-interfaces* Cloud-native NFV use casesNetwork Service Mesh controls the L2/L3 data planes to deliver these types of use cases. Network Service Mesh enables users to express the context of their network needs in a Cloud Native manner, rather than manually stringing together disjoint interfaces, IPAM, and subnets.Finally, we discuss how audience members can get involved and help drive the direction and development of NSM.\n",

      "description": "\n  Modern software development relies on many microservices working together, that in production may be distributed over different middleware systems, container schedulers, PaaS platforms and even different cloud providers. As production environments become more complex, and dynamic - establishing trust between microservices is becomes more difficult, creating challenges for developers, operations teams, and security teams alike. Enter SPIFFE (Secure Production Infrastructure for Everyone) and which builds on designs first championed at Google, Twitter and elsewhere to provide robust authentication and trust between disparate micro-services. SPIFFE and SPIRE make it trivial to establish trust between workloads that may be elastically scaled and dynamically scheduled, and deployed in deeply heterogeneous environments. We'll walk through the design goals for SPIFFE (a specification) and SPIRE (a multi-cloud implementation of SPIFFE). We will go over all the developments and progress in SPIRE over the last few months. We will present an overview of how it can be used in conjunction with Kubernetes to build secure and scalable microservice architectures. We will also share our current roadmap with the community.\n",

There are several possible “extension points” in Envoy as outlined in https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/tree/master/source/extensions. However, the currently available approaches to extend it is rather limited. Since Envoy is written in C++, the primary way to introduce new extended functionality in Envoy is by writing an extension (e.g. filters, either network or HTTP filter, as one of the most relevant use-cases in Envoy), in C++. It is also possible to write an extension for Envoy using Lua, but the current scope of this extension is only for HTTP traffic. This talk introduces the possibility to extend Envoy with WebAssembly-based extension and report the current progression of it.\n",

Sometimes, however, the process of finding that one piece of code in a large codebase that’s just right for your use case can feel like a scavenger hunt. But the spoils of the hunt are vast. This talk explores how the Linkerd project has leveraged the Kubernetes codebase to replace their bespoke code with existing code that's more robust and better tested. Specific examples include switching the project to use Kubernetes' shared informers for caching API responses and adding rate limiting via work queues for TLS certificate distribution. Linkerd's Kevin Lingerfelt will show you how to undertake an effective Go scavenger hunt, and he'll discuss when you should skip the hunt and write it from scratch.\n",

For example, it is common for a team to own a subset of services in a namespace, yet RBAC permissions grant that team access to other pods within the namespace.  We will demonstrate a number of solutions available for specific problems, such as pod network policies, the open policy agent, custom controllers that gate API functionality.  We will also discuss problems with the namespace permission model, and possible alternatives. Namespaces create an arbitrary boundary around resources, which creates the need to then bridge those boundaries. We will demonstrate ideas for bridging namespace networks, and posix-style objection permissions within a namespace.\n",

Using a repeatable build process maximizes container layer caching and takes advantage of Kubernetes built in pod template hashing. With this caching in place, it becomes feasible to deploy all services in a large repo reliably without under-deploying -- not deploying changed components, leaving them unvalidated on master -- or over-deploying, waiting for a potentially expensive rollout despite not having made changes.

      "description": "\n  Operating stateful applications is a challenge and Elasticsearch clusters are no exception. At Zalando, the search infrastructure heavily rely on large scale Elasticsearch clusters consisting of 100s of nodes.  In this talk Mikkel present how Zalando utilize Kubernetes and the operator pattern as introduced by CoreOS, to reliably and cost efficiently operate large scale Elasticsearch clusters.  The talk will walk through how the Elasticsearch operator was designed, what problems it solves and how building it from the bottom up allowed getting it in production fast, gather more learnings and later extending the featureset to make it less manual to operate and reducing the cost of the overall infrastructure.  While the talk revolves around running Elasticsearch, the ideas presented also apply to running other types of stateful applications in Kubernetes.\n",

      "description": "\n  In order to enable Single Sign-On in your cluster you need to configure the Kubernetes API server. This is an issue if you are using services where the control plane is managed for you. Some managed services like GKE support SSO out of the box, but are not configurable. Others like AKS allow you to configure it, but only with Active Directory. These options might not fit some of your requirements such as using your company’s existing Identity provider, to use other protocols such as LDAP or SAML or when applications (e.g the Kubernetes Dashboard) need access to the API server.   In this session, I will present some workarounds that leverage other native AuthN/AuthZ mechanisms such as service accounts or impersonation via auth proxies. I will also demo how to use these methods to enable SSO for the Kubernetes dashboard that can be used across different managed and on-prem environments.\n",

While Federation offers a solution to a problem (top-down resource declaration with templates, placements, and overrides), multicluster is about more than that. As Adrien was working on a different problem—peer-to-peer scheduling—he soon realized that some of the building blocks were missing: how to authorize requests from pods in a cluster to the Kubernetes APIs of other clusters; how to watch resources in a cluster to control resources in other clusters; how to garbage-collect objects in a cluster owned by objects in other clusters. Adrien started assembling an open-source \"multicluster toolbox\", composed of multicluster-service-account and multicluster-controller.

      "description": "\n  K8s Audit Logs are a new feature in K8s 1.11/1.13 which allow an operator to see a stream of events from the API server that show the changes being made to your cluster. In this talk, we’ll describe how auditing works and how to get it working it for popular K8s variants. Then we’ll dive into specific security-oriented use cases, showing how you can use audit logs to enforce security best practices, detect misuse, and fill the gap between what you think the cluster is running and what's actually running. Some specific use cases we’ll discuss include misuse of configmaps to hold sensitive data, overly loose permissions on pods/services, and abuse of cluster role bindings that grant too many (or the wrong) permissions. Attendees should come away with the ability to enable K8s Audit Support in their cluster and what to look for in their audit logs to ensure that their cluster is secure.\n",

In this talk, we will cover the basics of eBPF and then dive into a hands-on exploration of use cases where eBPF-based technologies like Cilium and BCC can enable security visibility and isolation well beyond what is possible with traditional Linux security primitives, Examples include:   1. Auditing the set of syscalls made by users who access pods via \"kubectl exec\".  2. Network visibility and access control that distinguishes between a sidecar and primary container inside a single pod.  3. API-layer visibility into inter-service connectivity, even if the connection is encrypted using TLS.\n",

What’s missing is a way to model and manage stateful services. Can we make stateful apps run as if they were stateless?  We’ll investigate the inherent challenges with serving stateful services from a scaling perspective while preserving responsiveness by designing for resilience and elasticity, using Akka—an OSS library for distributed stateful apps—as a concrete example.  We’ll discuss design principles needed to address problems around data consistency, system integrity, and data locality, why they are key to maintain overall system behavior under failure and load and discuss pitfalls and requirements needed to understand when operating the infrastructure fabric—f.e. Knative—which orchestrates the services.\n",

The analysis submission will be done via a jupyter notebook into a small cluster on our private cloud, and both the application and the cluster itself will automatically scale out to exhaust resources - we will detail our setup and deployment decisions on the way. Then we will show how the work being done in the Multicluster SIG helps us define a set of placement and scheduling policies to scale out to external clouds.  The end result will be a physicist’s dream: a histogram with a spike that back in 2012 indicated the discovery of a new particle.\n",

This keynote covers how to scale to thousands of clusters worldwide. You'll also hear why observability for every cluster change is critical. And don't forget about policy enforcement for cluster declarations. Bonus! A demo of Open Razee (a new open source project) shows how you can control and scale daily cluster updates.\n",

      "description": "\n  We often hear “Storage on Kubernetes is hard” or “Don’t deploy stateful applications on Kubernetes!” Is there any truth to these statements? In this talk I separate fact from fiction. Storage on Kubernetes can mean a lot of things. First I will start by separating three layers: 1) consuming block and file storage from a pod running in Kubernetes, 2) deploying a stateful app (like a database) on Kubernetes using storage and workload primitives, and 3) deploying a software defined storage system on top of Kubernetes to provide block or file storage. Each of these areas has a different set of challenges that are often conflated to make storage on Kubernetes appear much harder than it is.  After separating these layers, I will help you understand what the challenges are with each of them, and how you work around them to effectively deploy stateful applications on Kubernetes.\n",

Since Envoy is written in C++, the primary way to introduce new extended functionality in Envoy is by writing an extension (e.g. filters, either network or HTTP filter, as one of the most relevant use-cases in Envoy), in C++. It is possible to write an extension for Envoy using Lua (https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http_filters/lua_filter.html), but the current scope of this extension is only for HTTP traffic.\n",

Shaun and Evan will demonstrate how to enhance your service mesh to follow the Zero Trust network security model using SPIRE and Calico.  A Zero Trust Network emphasizes resilience to compromised services, hosts, and the network itself by treating every network connection as potentially hostile.

      "description": "\n  At BT it used to take us 2-3 years to get from a research idea to an AI algorithm that can be consumed by an end-user in production. We needed to reduce the risk and the investment required to bring our products to market and get essential feedback.We addressed three key areas to improve: having a diverse range of developer skills amongst us researchers, a lack of modern packaging \u0026 CI/CD practice, a need for a cloud-native model to shrink-wrap and run our code in production at scale.Our journey lead us to Serverless Functions, come to our talk to hear how we implemented our pipeline for development and deployment of AI algorithms using OpenFaaS. We can now ship to production in just two months improving the rate of delivery by 90%.The talk will also cover how BT built their platform using the UNIX-like primitives made available through the OpenFaaS eco-system and include a live demo.\n",

However, storage systems often need to extend beyond a single cluster to provide data to end users in many different locations. How can these globally distributed storage systems best be orchestrated and managed to meet the needs of their users on a global scale?  In this talk, we will examine the key concepts of storage orchestration for cloud native applications in multicloud environments, as well as the major benefits of these types of deployments. We will learn about the challenges that arise and best practices to address them, such as replication, mirroring, snapshots, and disaster recovery.

But the rapid development of SSD technology, along with container and Kubernetes, make it possible to create a more elegant solution from scratch, compared to the storage technologies exist tens of years ago.  So they have created a storage solution based on Kubernetes.  In Longhorn, control flow is driven by Kubernetes's controller model; deployment is done using Kubernetes workload; HA is backed by Kubernetes's HA capability. Though sometimes it's easy to say than done. As a result, lots of insights were gained on how to write an application based on Kubernetes.

Last year we finally kicked off the daunting multi-year task of migrating everything to gRPC.

How do you roll-out gRPC at scale whit minimal disruption to both the organization and to the end-user?

      "description": "\n  Kubernetes continues to adds features rapidly, but this makes it hard to install and operating a reliable kubernetes cluster. kops is an official OSS installation tool that makes kubernetes installation and operation turn-key.  But doing that requires that kops manage that complexity. We’ve had a busy year, migrating to etcd3, moving from an aggregated-apiserver to CRDs, starting to adopt the cluster-api. At the same time we’re taking the best pieces of kops and contributing them \"upstream\" into reusable modules - contributing to etcd-management and addon-management tools, as well as to the cluster-api.  We’ll give an overview of these changes and some of the challenges we faced, and share our strategies for dealing with the relentless pace of kubernetes change. We’ll also talk about how the upcoming roadmap for kubernetes, kops and for the components we’re spinning out of kops.\n",

How can it be exploited, and what does it all mean?  This deep dive will walk the audience through the Kubernetes back end, going over relevant concepts like aggregated API servers, the kubelet API, and permissions for namespace-constrained users. We will explain the details of how this flaw works, how a cluster’s moving parts can fit together to create a vulnerable context, and the risks involved in leaving this CVE unpatched in the wild.  A live demonstration will show the audience exactly how easy it is to exploit this vulnerability. After explaining the attack pathways, the audience will leave with practical advice about mitigation and how to protect their clusters.\n",

This enables a new use case like enriching an application with AI-powered analytics using video stream in real-time. NTT Communications has developed a new platform with Kubernetes and gRPC.

      "description": "\n  Kubernetes traditionally uses metrics for its core scheduling decisions - in the beginning all of this started with an opinionated internal stack. Since then Kubernetes has introduced 3 orthogonal standardized metrics APIs. As of today many implementations exist - i.e. for cloud providers and on premise.  In this talk we will first show the community process around metrics in Kubernetes, how the Special Interest Group (SIG) for instrumentation works and how to get involved. We will do an overview and deep dive in all 3 metric APIs, with a concrete fully open source Prometheus based deployment example. Once we have Prometheus running we will show how to bridge the gap between Prometheus and Kubernetes to use these APIs. Finally, we will conclude the talk with an example on scaling your deployments based on custom metrics served by your Prometheus with the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.\n",

Components will inevitably fail at this scale, but human intervention to detect and correct these failures is unsustainable. This is where Kubernetes shines. With a declarative API and guarantees of eventual consistency, Kubernetes is able to continuously monitor the system and take actions to keep the cluster healthy.  This talk provides an architectural overview of the self-healing capabilities of Kubernetes. We will discuss how these capabilities are born from the declarative API, and how Kubernetes components work together to drive to the desired state. We will provide detailed examples from the volume subsystem which automatically makes storage available to containers. We will end by revealing edge cases that Kubernetes currently doesn’t handle well, and explain the plans to address these issues.\n",

We'll go into how the expansion is done, what needs to be done in the legacy systems and what obstacles we had to overcome.

Kubernetes clusters that integrate with external network infrastructure (such as a cloud provider) need a way to coordinate Kubernetes Pod “readiness” with setup latencies in the network fabric. Not tackling this problem causes lost packets and dropped connections OR requires inserting worst-case delays to pod startup to account for external setup. It allows Foremast, an open source engine to maintain the health of applications running on K8s, to remediate similar problems in a much smoother way. Minhan and Ping will cover the coordination problem, how the new pod readiness gate API fixes the issue and experiences from both Google and Intuit using the API with real workloads. At Google, this API is used to ensure no traffic disruption occurs for user service across changes to the workload. At Intuit, this API is used to maintain application health during canary deployment using Foremast.\n",

      "description": "\n  When responding to an incident in your containers, you don’t necessarily have the same tools at your disposal that you do with VMs - and so your incident investigation process and forensics are different. In a best case scenario, you have access to application logs, orchestrator logs, node snapshots, and more. In this talk, we’ll go over where to get information about what’s happening in your cluster, including logs and open source tools you can install, and how to tie this information together to get a better idea of what’s happening in your infrastructure. Armed with this info, we’ll review the common mitigation options such as to alert, isolate, pause, restart, or kill a container. For common types of container attacks, we'll discuss what options are best and why. Lastly, we’ll talk about restoring services after an incident, and the best steps to take to prevent the next one.\n",

      "description": "\n  Edge computing is becoming the major component in 5G networks. While edge computing provides an u-low-latency solution, it brings with it other challenges. On one hand, edge clouds are small, and their computing resources are scarce. On the other hand, they are required to serve many applications, such as the 5G edge ecosystem, live video streaming and IoT. The edge gives the opportunity for vendors to deploy their own software. However, this needs to be done in an agile manner. With the proliferation of IoT devices and Autonomous cars of different brands, the industry cannot afford countless years and M$ integration projects. In this session, we will show how we meet these challenges using ONAP, Cloudify, Akraino and other open source projects. We will show a real use case of the full ML-driven life cycle management of applications running on an edge cloud using serverless technology.\n",

The mpi-operator, on the other hand, utilize MPI allreduce primitive implementation. While the parameter server strategy requires a right ratio of CPU (for parameter servers) and GPU (for workers) to reach network-optimal, the all reduce distribution might be easier to optimize network cost.

However, there are still challenges with deployment, especially with choosing a storage backend that is best suited to support your application across multiple failure domains.  In this talk, we will discuss improvements that make it easier to run stateful applications across multiple failure domains for increased availability, and demonstrate how Kubernetes automatically recovers from failure scenarios at the node and zone layers. We will also discuss different categories of storage and their pros and cons in these failure scenarios.   You will walk away with a better understanding of Kubernetes’ scheduling and failure recovery capabilities with respect to stateful workloads, and which types of storage backends are most appropriate to meet your stateful application’s availability, reliability, and performance goals.\n",

A service mesh is in a unique place to enforce security features like mTLS - Learn how to ensure that there are no exploitable \"gaps\" within the end-to-end/user-to-service communication path.  - Explore the differences in ingress/mesh control planes, with brief demonstrations using Ambassador and Consul Connect\n",

Sounds interesting? Come see us do it live right in front of you! After we review the design choices and architecture of the cluster, we will use it to showcase the use of Rook, the CNCF's incubation project designed to be a cloud-native storage orchestrator for Kubernetes, turning storage technologies into a service completely transparent to the user.   A comprehensive examination of uses and open problems will complement our review of Rook's architecture. We will deep-dive into what it does well, what it does not do (yet), and what are the operational trade-offs of using a storage operator. With live access to a running cluster, we will showcase Rook in action as we discuss its capabilities.\n",

That the API is a set of resources rather than a list of methods on objects is a bit mind bending. But this programming model is not entirely new – rather, it smacks quite heavily of functional programming.  Functional programming had mostly been relegated to academic endeavors until recently. What’s changed that is that our apps are now distributed systems and are simply too complex for us to reason about without help. Kubernetes helps.   In order to effectively use Kubernetes to deploy and manage your workloads you need to understand some of the principles of functional programming and how they surface in K8s. In this session I will cover these underlying principles of the K8s programming model so that you can up the robustness and manageability of your application deployments.\n",

Asking an open source project to put more effort into supporting your favourite language (Ruby in my case) is asking to be hit by your own boomerang - \"that's a great idea, why don't you get started?\"  In this talk I'll describe how I got hit by my own Ruby boomerang and wound up maintaining the Ruby FDK for the Fn project (not my day job).  I'll cover: - why I believe we need open source serverless - the Fn project - the Ruby FDK (Function Development Kit) - my experience of contributing to open source - why I still want to be involved - how I've encouraged others to start - why you might want to get involved\n",

Squash connects powerful and mature debuggers (gdb, dlv, java debugging) to your microservices while they run in Kubernetes. Loop extends the capability of your service mesh to observe your application and record full transactions for sandboxed replay and debugging.Come to this demo-heavy talk to see how together, Squash, Gloo Shot, and Loop allow you to trigger, replay, and investigate failure modes of your microservices in a language agnostic and efficient manner without requiring any changes to your code.\n",

      "description": "\n  TPM is a discrete tamper-resistant device soldered to the motherboard and it operates independently of its host.  TPM devices are designed to protect sensitive credentials at the hardware level: credentials created and stored within TPM devices cannot be extracted, even if host is compromised. Additionally, TPM devices provide a suite of cryptographic operations for applications to leverage.  In this demo heavy session, we will review core TPM capabilities and how they could be used in for extending Kubernetes security.   Attendees will leave with understanding how to utilize TPM in the context of Kubernetes. Concretely, the following scenarios will be covered: - Bootstrap trusted identity of cluster nodes  - Seal sensitive data  - Generate cryptographically protected logs - Generate unexportable TLS credentials\n",

The solution relies on a combination of an MQTT broker such as Google IoT Core together with an edge deployed registry, database and serverless functions. In this retail solution, all edge devices are managed in the cloud, while edge computing is managed through serverless functions. Edge storage is managed with a multi model database which stores time series and machine learning models, building applications on top of Kubernetes to benefit from a cloud-native architecture. Lev will demonstrate the update of functions through the MQTT broker, managing revisions and monitoring status. He will also demo machine learning models for image recognition and predictive analytics with serverless.\n",

As soon as a change is in the mainline it’s on the release train and any subsequent changes traditionally ended up in a queue. If that change has a delay, then all subsequent changes get stuck and then have to be released together.  There are many ways to try and avoid these problems, but one way is to stop items getting on the release train until it's ready.  Istio does many things, but the traffic management functionality is the key to this solution. It allows traffic to be routed to different versions of the same service. The Wealth Wizards implementation will route all traffic to the mainline or master version of a service by default. However, if the hostname includes a version prefix then it will route traffic to the corresponding version of the service, if it exists.\n",

This will be followed by a deep dive into Kubernetes architectural features and constraints in the context of both approaches. We'll see which course makes the most sense for some specific use cases. Next we'll discuss some common challenges to successful deployments, such as resource limits and network availability, and provide some guidance on how to deal with them.

The onus is on the user to orchestrate these industry standard strategies often using error prone scripts. To address this need, Intuit open sourced a deployment controller called Argo Rollouts that codifies these industry standard strategies into an custom resource called Rollout. This session will discuss how Intuit leverages rollouts of hundreds of apps in a GitOps style to implement these missing strategies, the challenges in converting inherently imperative strategies into a declarative configuration, and envisioning the future for GitOps based deployments.\n",

In k8s, each node effectively becomes a switch/router of the traffic passing between the PODs. Some k8s CNI plugins allow using these protocols to export traffic flow information as well. Together with good analysis tools, this can provide better visibility into the network in the cluster (both in real time and in history), which is crucial for debugging networking issues, identifying the bottlenecks, or investigation of security incidents.  In this talk, I will showcase how a powerful IPFIX collector and analyzer for k8s can be build using existing open-source tools: GoFlow and Logstash for collecting and post-processing of the flow records, Elasticsearch as the storage and search engine for the flows, and Prometheus + Kibana for easy observability of the flows.\n",

Knative is no different in this respect and until recently our cold-start time was measured in seconds due to the cost of Kubernetes deployments. Recently, a large effort was undertaken to improve this delay and the result is a system which scales Kubernetes deployments up from 0 in nearly a second. We will dive deep into what actually goes on inside Kubernetes when a deployment is scaled up, how we determined where time is spent, and then some of our novel techniques to drastically speed up this process.\n",

Securing the data is a priority for every organization and is influenced by the technologies they use, legal regulations, internal conventions, and so on. Enforcing policies to protect the data is difficult because it often affects the entire stack, requires state from multiple locations, and must evolve over time as business needs change.  In this talk, we will see how the Open Policy Agent (OPA) can be integrated with Ceph to guard access to sensitive data while satisfying strict latency and availability requirements.  In our demo we will deploy Ceph in Kubernetes using Rook and show how to enforce custom policies over the Ceph Storage Cluster.\n",

Unfortunately, a nearly unlimited number of unique potential paths tends to overwhelm time series capture, making it difficult to get a clear picture of service behaviors. In this talk I’ll introduce the concept of the Service Profile, a custom Kubernetes resource used by Linkerd. The service profile lets operators define permitted routes for the service with regular expressions, which allows Prometheus to scrape and aggregate service behaviors in a manageable way. It also allows operators to set detailed service behavior rules such as retries and timeouts that can be easily reproduced and monitored.\n",

We'll talk about the docs workflow: how SIG Docs does the work to review and publish docs. During the deep dive, we'll explore the docs contributor guide and do some hands-on contribution. Remember that contributing to docs is a pathway to Kubernetes membership!\n",

This includes not only active automated approaches such as Cluster Federation, but also those that employ batch workflow-style continuous deployment systems like Spinnaker and others. Standalone building blocks for these and other similar systems (for example a cluster registry), and proposed changes to kubernetes core where appropriate are in scope.In the introduction, we will give you an overview of the projects we're currently actively working on, how best to get involved, and what our future plans look like.Then we'll dive deeper! We recently released the second version of our biggest project, Federation v2 as Beta, and have gathered user feedback on how and why several different companies are using it to solve their particular multi-cluster use cases. In this deep-dive session we'll take you through what's in this beta release, and the results of our findings about its real-world usage.\n",

Writing reliable distributed microservices is notoriously difficult, even with Kubernetes help. In the absence of a coherent and cohesive set of standard open source distributed computing primitives available across all programming languages, things get really hard. We take for granted standard primitives provided by Linux like file systems, virtual memory, threads, network sockets, and locks. Without them, modern application development would be almost impossible. Yet distributed systems require different primitives for things like consistent replication, sharding, distributed shared memory, load balancing, failure handling, and auto-scaling. What should these primitives look like, and how do they work?\n",

The community is beginning to leverage Kubernetes to deploy and manage the machine learning workload.  One of the key challenges is to schedule the GPU-intensive workload. The Kubernetes has included GPU support for applications. However, there are some limitations of GPU usage:  1. GPU assignment is exclusive. Containers cannot share GPU resources. 2. A container can request one or more GPUs, but it is not possible to request a fraction of a GPU.  This session introduces how to run workload using the GPU in Kubernetes. In addition, an approach will be demonstrated to use virtual GPU (vGPU) technology to enable multiple pods concurrently accessing the same physical GPU. This approach not only increases the utilization of GPU resources, it also allows more GPU workloads to be scheduled on the same physical GPU.\n",

Reducing cognitive load makes oncall more effective. When dashboards are organized hierarchically on both the service and the resource level, troubleshooting becomes an exercise of divide and conquer. The oncall person can quickly eliminate whole areas of problems and zone in on the real issue. At that point a single service or instance should have been identified, for which more detailed debugging can take place.\n",
