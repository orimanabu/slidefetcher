They help human operators, and administrators to run their applications efficiently and effectively. On Operator Day, Canonical speakers and guests share knowledge and insights about the journey from configuration management to application management. Canonical provides an entirely OSS-based platform and framework for software operators - Juju and the Charmed Operators. The various sessions will cover software operators, what they represent, how to use them, how to create them and how we can take advantage of them. And of course, we are happy to cover this demand with the fourth edition of the Operator Day for the Kubecon EU 2022. Because of the uncertainties with planning travels between countries remain, we decided to run the event entirely virtually.What to expect from Operator Day KubeCon EU 2022?Charmed OperatorsOperator Day at KubeCon EU 2022 will talk about software operators and share best practices and insights on operating Kubernetes applications, as well as explore the Canonical implementation of Kubernetes Operators, the Charmed Operators. Each session can be attended individually, but we recommend attending them in a sequence as the presentations build upon each other.Observability and roadmap updateAs observability becomes more and more important for operations, the operators are even applied to the integration of an observability stack. Also on that day, insights on the road map of the framework for Charmed Operators from Canonical are given and updates on community-driven collection of operators will be presented.The future of cloud-native and KubernetesAnd last but not least, and very popular at the previous operator days, we have invited industry thought leaders to join a one-off panel discussion on the state and future of cloud-native and Kubernetes.How to Register: Pre-registration is required.

This is the main motivator for proposing this talk. I would like also to gather some insights, from a systems thinking and organisational psychology standpoint, on how highly resilient organisations in different domains handle the human component of failures, as I think it is useful to have this perspective.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

Using the 'Cloud Native SD-WAN' open-source project, Egress configuration from Service Meshes can now be used to program SD-WAN optimizations towards remote external services.This leverages the 'SaaS optimization' feature offered by several SD-WAN solutions. SaaS optimization enhances connectivity towards SaaS applications (either public SaaS or user-defined remote applications) by constantly probing the remote application from different points of the SD-WAN network to continually compute the best path to reach it.On the Service Mesh side, Egress configurations are used to learn which external services should be probed (and how) to get their traffic optimized. What is typically used to enforce security policies (e.g. allow/deny) can be transposed into traffic engineering optimizations on the SD-WAN.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

From our experience and what we see in the Kubernetes community Slack channels, when developers hit the tipping point of not being able to run all their services locally, they run into trouble. At this time, they suddenly realize they need new tooling and approaches for observing and debugging applications that will spread across their local dev machines and remote clusters. This presentation will show operators and developers how Linkerd and Telepresence offer a simple way to better observe and debug applications running in their clusters.

The Ohio Supercomputer Center is currently using Open OnDemand and Kubernetes to securely support virtual classrooms that require running RStudio Server and Jupyter.

For authorities (EBA, EIOPA, ESMA) having a flexible multicloud strategy and solid foundations for portability and interoperability has never been more relevant. In this session, Mateusz will present a good practice guide offering practical tips and tricks for designing and deploying Cloud Native business-critical systems in Financial Institutions fulfilling the assumption of having an easily portable architecture, with an easily tested Exit Plan and finally minimizing cloud concentration risk.

From a slow, manual, and uncontrolled processor it has become over time fast, automated, and versioned. The tools have evolved, changed, been modernized, or even containerized, but they have remained centralized. The new generation of solutions intends to reverse this point of view by relying no longer on orchestration but on choreography between the different stakeholders. This session shows the difference between these two concepts and how it applies to the CI/CD domain that has remained ultimately very centralized and old-school then describes an innovative solution, (cartographer.sh) based on the concept of supply chains.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

      "description": "Most Kuberrnetes developers are familiar with the painful process of debugging a pod within a cluster. Fortunately, a new, cutting-edge approach — ephemeral containers — simplifies debugging running pods and more! With ephemeral containers, you can dynamically deploy a container that shares pod resources. These containers use Linux namespaces to share network and process resources so debugging can occur using a container image of your choosing. During this talk, Aaron will cover the what, why and how of ephemeral containers, and the underlying mechanics that make ephemeral containers useful for debugging and testing.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

      "description": "Recent applications are latency-sensitive, demanding low latency between microservices in the application. Current scheduling algorithms in Kubernetes aim to reduce costs and increase resource efficiency, which is not enough for applications where end-to-end latency becomes a primary objective. Applications such as databases and multi-tier web services would benefit the most from network-aware scheduling policies that consider latency and bandwidth in addition to default resources (CPU and memory). We introduce a network-aware scheduling framework to tackle this challenge, including two controllers (AppGroup and NetworkTopology) and three scheduling plugins (TopologicalSort, NodeNetworkCostFit, and NetworkMinCost). The framework ensures bandwidth reservations and optimizes the end-to-end application latency since it schedules pods in an application with chained dependencies close to each other. We will show a demo highlighting the benefits of our framework.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

      "description": "Kubernetes' agility, versatility, and resource scaling make it a platform of choice for data science, especially for shared environments. However, data scientists often need to work with lots of different libraries, languages, and applications, often with multiple versions. Conventional approaches, with a legion of tailored images or a huge 20GB golden image, do not match the reality of production. In this session, we will demonstrate how you can leverage the concept of environment modules inside Kubernetes to solve the challenges of synchronously managing multiple containers of different types, making thousands of scientific libraries, languages and packages dynamically available in a simple way. Inspired by work done and heavily used in the High Performance Computing (HPC) community, we will share a specific implementation that brings this production-proven architecture to Kubernetes and talk about how you can implement it in your own environment.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

One such tool is The Falco Project - an incubating CNCF tool for detecting malicious activity at run time. Falco, like many security tools, has some gaps. This talk highlights these gaps by introducing various techniques to silently bypass the default Falco ruleset (based on Falco v0.30.0 release). The attendees will learn 9 different classes of bypasses, 7 of which are novel and have never been presented. The bypasses allow for stealthy target enumeration, privilege escalation and lateral movement. To aid with the bypass automation, Shay will introduce a special container image and multiple code snippets built specifically for Falco bypasses. To wrap up, we will apply the bypass techniques on securekubernetes cluster (presented on KubeCon NA 2019) and demonstrate how an attacker can achieve full cluster compromise without tripping the SOC.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

      "description": "Kubernetes supports efficient utilization of resources by enabling applications to request the precise amounts of resources it needs. Unlike fractional requests for CPUs, fractional requests for GPUs are not allowed in Kubernetes. GPU resources requested in the pod manifest must be an integer number. This means one GPU is fully allocated to one container even if the container only needs a fraction of GPU for its workload. Without the support for fractional GPUs, GPU resources are invariably over provisioned leading to a wastage. This is especially true for inference workloads that process a handful of data samples in real-time. To address this limitation, we have developed user-friendly solutions that allow a single GPU to be shared by multiple containers thereby improving utilization of GPUs and saving cost. In this talk, we will show the demos of our solutions and share performance results.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

Whether you are in 5G, AI/ML, HPC, or NFV, you have many more considerations to optimize your workloads. You may care about how busy the node is, how many GPU cards are attached, whether a minimal throughput is available, or whether the node is cooler than the temperature required for basic cooking. Fortunately, Kubernetes allows for extensions to its scheduling paradigm, which allows for new creative solutions going forward. Using these capabilities, we have created a way to use knowledge of your resources to impact your scheduling decisions. Telemetry Aware Scheduling and GPU Aware Scheduling, both open-source projects, enable you to use a variety of metrics in intelligent scheduling.

K8s has done a great job at de-privileging the node agent, the Kubelet, but nodes also host other credentials - their pods' service account tokens. Following an escape, the attacker can easily harvest and abuse tokens of neighboring pods.In this talk, Yuval and Shaul will introduce the concept of Trampoline Pods - pods so powerful that if their node goes rogue, it could launch devastating attacks against the cluster and in some cases completely take over it. Covering managed K8s services and common cluster add-ons, they'll reveal the trampoline pods installed by popular K8s platforms.

Onkar has worked with multiple organizations to help them deploy Dex and configure the LDAP connector to meet such authentication requirements. During this hands-on tutorial, attendees will set up an open source AD server and add users and groups, then configure the Dex LDAP connector.

      "description": "Nowadays, the popularity of event-driven applications is rising, they enable us to design and develop scalable, distributed, and flexible systems. Kubernetes platform brings the distributed and flexible aspect, though it doesn't provide any built-in way to deal with event-driven scaling properly. Scaling based on CPU and/or memory usage doesn’t fit well with event-driven processes. The majority of autoscaling solutions are usually complex, and their scopes are too attached to a specific provider. KEDA came to solve these problems, providing a simple way to gather the metrics from external sources and translate them into Kubernetes metrics to drive the event-driven autoscaling. During this session, we will introduce KEDA: what it is, how it works, show it in action, and discuss future development.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

How much information can they get for fingerprinting the cluster? Kernel versions, IP addresses, instance types, library versions…the list goes on and on. In this session, you will learn how attackers use this information in the first part of reconnaissance, to see if you are vulnerable. The speakers will share - What secrets they collect to fingerprint your Kubernetes cluster (hint: they're not after your timeseries) - How to leverage this information internally to secure your cluster - How to prevent the exposition of sensitive information No matter how many safety best practices you apply, you must be aware of every link of the chain.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

This talk will look back on my experience of building platforms, both as an end-user and now as part of an organization helping our customers do the same. The key takeaways are: - Treat platform as a product - Realize that you can’t have good developer experience (DevEx) without good UX - Focus on workflows and tooling interoperability We’ll wrap this talk with a walk-through of the CNCF ecosystem through the developer control plane lens, and look at what’s next in the future of this important emerging category.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

However, some applications like distributed caches can take a while to warm up to a running state, while batch workers would rather avoid being terminated before they're done. At Slack, such applications found their home in Kubernetes thanks to a two-sided system: one one hand an admission webhook injects tolerations in pods to inform their requirement to be long-lived, and on the other hand a custom service taints nodes with their uptime. This results in pods desiring a long life to be scheduled on young nodes less likely to be terminated early. This talk will first describe how to write a simple Kubernetes admission webhook (https://github.com/slackhq/simple-kubernetes-webhook) to inject tolerations in pods, then move onto the symbiotic node tainting system, and end with gotchas and some metrics on how this long-lived pod support is used at Slack.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

      "description": "A challenge when tuning a Kubernetes microservices application is identifying the container size (CPU and Memory), due to frequent application changes and varying traffic patterns. Kubernetes autoscalers are the standard solution to automatically adjust Kubernetes container resources for service efficiency. We present the results of an extensive tuning activity we successfully conducted on a Kubernetes application delivering business-critical financial services to SMB customers. Our goal was to minimize cloud cost without compromising on performance of this application. The unexpected result was that configurations minimizing the service cost were not recommended by the autoscaler. Indeed, autoscalers work by adjusting resource sizing wrt the historical usage, without being aware of the actual cost of cloud resources and of the impact on application performance. In our session, we illustrate how you can use our exploratory testing approach we leveraged to get these results.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

      "description": "Applying seccomp profiles to Kubernetes workloads is one of the most efficient ways in securing containers. The profiles have to be created with care and need to be maintained over the complete lifecycle of the application. This manual effort causes that many applications either stick to the runtime default profile or turn the feature off at all. In this talk, Sascha will demonstrate how to create a custom seccomp profile for a specific containerized application. It will cover the basic techniques of collecting the required syscalls by hand, and also advanced ways of utilizing eBPF and automatic audit log tracing. The session will also discuss the drawbacks of relying on automations. In the end, Sascha will show how to create multi architecture profiles and utilizes in-cluster enhancements like the Security Profiles Operator to create an application specific profile.

There are two major challenges: cold start latency and autoscaling speed in response to bursty traffic. Cold start latency refers to the time it takes to create a new function instance and get it ready to start execution. Autoscaling refers to the operation of automatically adjusting the number of running function instances to meet the traffic demand. This talk provides a detailed analysis of what causes the cold start latency and the autoscaling bottleneck. It then presents a new approach that reduces the cold start latency through instantiating a new function instance from a combination of its memory snapshot and its essential code chunks. The authors will share their learnings and test results. On the autoscaling part, the authors will share their insight of using an elastic function sandbox to boost the auto-scaling speed.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

While container orchestration frameworks provide advantages like resiliency, elasticity, and declarative management, they are not designed to enable application performance to the same degree as HPC workload managers and schedulers. In response to increased interest in scheduling flexibility, the Kubernetes community developed the Scheduling Framework to facilitate integration of new policies and schedulers. We present KubeFlux, a Scheduling Framework plugin based on the Fluxion open-source HPC scheduler developed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. We discuss uses for KubeFlux and compare the performance of an application scheduled by the Kubernetes default scheduler and KubeFlux.

While Kubernetes allows for other paradigms on top of it which allows pods to coordinate on individual jobs, setting them up and making them play nice with ML platforms is not straightforward. Using Apache Spark and Apache Mahout we can work with matrices of any dimension and distribute them across an unbounded number of pods/nodes, and we can use Kubeflow to make our work quickly and easily reproducible. In this talk, we’ll discuss how we used Apache Spark and Mahout to denoise DICOM images of lungs of COVID patients and published our Pipeline with Kubeflow to make the process easily repeatable which could help doctors in more resource limited hospitals, as well as other researchers seeking to automate the detection of COVID.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

The use of SPIFFE can significantly reduce costs associated with the overhead of managing and issuing cryptographic identity documents and accelerate development by removing the need for developers to understand the complexity involved to secure service-to-service communication, but that is not the only outcome. Production identity can have a positive impact on many areas such as interoperability, compliance, audibility, and more.

But, organizations are still challenged to make developers productive using Kubernetes. PlatformOps teams are now being asked to build, run, and manage platforms that lead with developer experience.This requires embracing a PlatformOps philosophy that treats developers as customers while meeting their organization’s policies. VMware understands this transition building on 20 years of stewarding the most popular Java framework, Spring, which fundamentally changed the enterprise Java landscape on the back of a superior developer experience. That history allows us to identify patterns and attributes that we believe are critical to delivering a better cloud native developer experience on Kubernetes.In this talk we’ll focus on three things PlatformOps teams should focus on:Reducing complexity without sacrificing flexibilityShifting outcomes left without shifting the burden leftEnsuring consistency and security without giving up agilityJoin Ben Hale, VMware Senior Staff Engineer and Technical Lead for VMware Tanzu® developer experience, as he shares the core values of a great developer experience on Kubernetes based on his multi-decade career building application development tools and working with one of today’s most thriving open source developer communities, Spring.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

It is now beginning to play a major role in CI/CD apart from Ops and figures as an aid that improves developer experience. Chaos frameworks are beginning to feature in the list of must-have dev tools. In this session, we discuss the role of Chaos Engineering in stepping up the cloud native dev experience and how developers can use cloud native chaos tests to verify the resilience of their application even before the code is merged. Okteto is an open source tool that enables developers to deploy development environments directly in Kubernetes. The community behind Okteto has succeeded with the idea of providing cloud native chaos tests to the developers in their toolset. In this session we take examples of Litmus chaos tests on Okteto and show how developers can run them as part of the development process, rather than just on CI.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

The journey has not been without challenges, where the platform team has managed technical and functional requirements including an access model in an enterprise environment, user expectations of cloud native infrastructure usage, and issues with excessive API load, shared resources, as well as controllers written by the team and open sourced along the way.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

In particular, with Timeseries Metrics, the choice is often to choose between substandard upstream offerings (such as the Prometheus Pushgateway), or capitulate to vendor lock-in and utilise a platform provided by your Cloud provider. So if we want to continue to use our existing Prometheus systems, then what choices do we have? This talk will cover the issues around existing solutions, Colin's solution to these issues that is currently in production at Cloudflare, and where we can go in upstream to make the experience better going forward.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

The old way of doing things is to manually gather evidence once or twice a year and hope nothing bad is found during your audit. This is not fun. In this talk, we’ll go over the concepts of continuous compliance and how to apply this to your current DevSecOps program. Zeal will talk about how the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) can be used to create automated control based assessments.

      "description": "Elasticsearch (and its fork, OpenSearch) is the go-to storage for logs. As with any storage, the cluster likely needs to scale to keep up with the change of load. But autoscaling Elasticsearch isn't trivial: indices and shards need to be well sized and well balanced across nodes. Otherwise the cluster will have hotspots and scaling it further will be less and less efficient. This talk focuses on two aspects: - best practices around scaling Elasticsearch for logs and other time-series data - how to apply them when deploying Elasticsearch on Kubernetes. In the process, a new (open-source) operator will be introduced (yes, there will be a demo!). This operator will autoscale Elasticsearch while keeping a good balance of load. It does so by changing the number of shards in the index template and rotating indices when the number of nodes changes.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

But many engineers understand it only as a black-box, hidden by simplifying levels of abstraction. The purpose of this workshop is to provide a hands-on workshop that will bridge those gaps in Envoy understanding. Participants will explore first principles regarding Envoy architecture, filter chains, and a day-in-the-life of a request. Users will then put those principles to work interactively. Every participant will have access to a computing environment via their web browsers to a Kubernetes K3s platform provisioned with Envoy and supporting tools. From there, users will explore the life of a request through a maze of transforms, custom processing with WebAssembly, and request routing. They will further learn to employ standard Envoy tools like metrics, access logging, and the Tap filter to solve real-world problems.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

This session walks you through mitigating critical vulnerabilities in popular container images like Java-based ones, from the obvious to the sneaky ones, and how to leverage layer explorer tools to narrow the search field for the latter. It is meant to be a hands-on session, first we will use Aqua’s Trivy scanner to analyze an image generated for a Spring Boot app and then wagoodman's dive to explore in which layer we are introducing a version of a library with critical vulnerabilities, while Maven seems to tell us otherwise.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

This talk will explain the basic technology behind eBPF while presenting some examples of how to use data collected via eBPF for a variety of software quality use cases. We'll use the Pixie CNCF sandbox project to pull data and replicate production issues on the developer desktop for debugging.

And increasingly it’s being adopted inside commercial products and other OSS projects (e.g. EKS-Anywhere). With this growth comes an increase in the variety of the Cluster API Providers you can choose from. What if none of the existing providers suit your use case? Perhaps you want to bring your own hosts or integrate with a custom infrastructure provisioning mechanism. If that's the case, this talk is for you. Come learn from the maintainers of existing CAPI providers on how to get started creating your own provider. It’s hard but at the same time easier than it sounds. Although every provider has unique considerations in its offering, there is a lot of commonality when it comes to writing a provider. This talk will highlight the common patterns, develop and debug workflows, and common pitfalls / gotchas to take into account when writing your own provider.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

With the advent of Github, sometimes now code and sample data too, unfortunately this still leaves a lot of “leg work” to the person reproducing (which is why this is often a task for graduate students). But Kubeflow, an Open Source, Cloud Native, Data Science Platform, changes that by making all steps from data cleansing to visualization quickly and easily reproducible which in turn makes iterative advances much easier and faster. In this talk, we’ll discuss a peer review article that was published not only with corresponding code, but with a Kubeflow Pipeline, so that anyone may download, check, and iteratively improve the results. While the paper itself is interesting- the talk will focus on why publishing not only code and data but full pipelines benefits not only grad students tasked with verifying results, but the entire academic community.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

This talk will give an overview of lessons learned and tools we have created that you can reuse in your own projects to secure your releases. It will center around three key moments and technologies: The initial effort involved producing SBOMs to describe sources and artifacts along with their dependencies.

We will also be providing a sneak peek of some of the multi-cluster challenges with Kubernetes and Kube-Fed. Four architectural patterns will be covered with worked examples: The first pattern will be within an AZ, how to work with PVs. The next pattern will be spanning three AZs, and how to embrace or work around PV/AZ affinity constraints. The next pattern is three AZs and two regions within a single provider. Here we start to see physical limitations such as the speed of light begin to impinge on our patterns.

Now, as engineers look toward migrating to multi-cloud architectures, systems and processes may need to be migrated to new technologies. But what choices are available, how do they fit together and how can the CNCF landscape help? This talk discusses the cloud native technologies that can be used to convert to a multi-cloud architecture and highlights some of the lessons learned from taking this journey on at Form3. The audience will learn: - How to decide if multi-cloud is essential for them - The fundamentals of deploying services across multiple clouds with Kubernetes - How to leverage Cilium to mesh together multiple clusters - The basics of event sourcing using NATS in the multi-cloud world - Resilient and performant data storage using CockroachDB This talk is useful for any new comers to the cloud native landscape, as well as those curious about going multi-cloud!Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

      "description": "Operating a distributed database on a single Kubernetes cluster is interesting, but how about transparently migrating it from one cluster to another–potentially between different cloud providers– without impacting user workloads? Kubernetes has become the de facto default deployment for ArangoDB, a distributed Graph database. Consider for example ArangoDB Oasis, a managed Cloud Database service with over 200 deployments (aka highly available database clusters) across three major cloud providers and many regions. But outages, (Kubernetes) upgrades, resource considerations, and cost optimizations require the underlying infrastructure to be very dynamic including migration between Kubernetes cluster, datacenter, or even cloud providers. This talk provides insights into how Kube-Arango, the OSS operator for ArangoDB, supports live migration of distributed stateful applications without impact on users. Challenges in such migration include for example networking, DNS, and persistent data.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

So what can open source maintainers do to help ensure mentees are successful in their cloud native journeys? And more broadly, how can maintainers use these opportunities to build a long lasting and inclusive community? In this talk, Lucas discusses challenges, successes, and lucky breaks he experienced through two years of non-stop mentorship as a maintainer of Thanos.

High-quality normal traffic generated by the ‘human’ operator, has a significant impact on the testing results. Since the scale of testing is growing, increasing the number of operators is not practical and not cost-effective, so automating the generation of realistic normal traffic is becoming necessary. A BotNet can launch large-scale DDoS by orchestrating thousands of \"infected\" clients or “bad bots”. Similarly, if we can deploy thousands of human activity agents or “good bots” and orchestrate them together, we can generate a large number of emulated normal traffic from users. This talk will show how to utilize Kubernetes to orchestrate a large number of containerized bots to execute human activities in the testbed.

How does a container image travel to persistent storage in the cloud? What does it look like when it gets there? We hadn't thought much about these questions until we started building DigitalOcean Container Registry (DOCR) on top of the CNCF Distribution codebase in 2019. Working on DOCR required us to learn a lot of the answers and we're excited to share them. In this talk we'll pull back the curtain on how Distribution works. From your registry client, to the OCI Distribution API, to the CNCF Distribution codebase, to bytes on disk, we'll explain exactly how a container image makes it from your computer to the cloud, what it looks like when it gets there, and what happens when you ask for it back.

While developers can joyfully make cloud spending explode, traditional finance and procurement departments look around in wonder. The FinOps approach and the Foundation, which coined the word, dedicate itself to continuously enhancing best practices around cloud financial management. Managing Kubernetes resources is the masterclass of it. Having cost transparency and control over many dynamically scaling containers across many server instances can be difficult. Vanessa and Manuela share the experience in monitoring Kubernetes costs and planning budgets accordingly. This session covers how engineers – responsible for incurring costs – can support cloud cost management to prevent overspending and how this approach enables and empowers colleagues from finance, procurement and business in their daily doing. This, in turn, gives the engineer more freedom to explore new solutions.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

      "description": "Kubernetes is a very open system allowing developers a great extent of freedom. However it still follows rules, design principles and sets well-described boundaries. It constrains developers to well understood cans and cants. Prohibiting cross-namespace ownership of resources is one of such rules. A namespace scoped resource can't be an owner to a resource in a different namespace. Yet, there always is that one use case that we can't solve in any other way than by smashing through those walls of rules. We will explore why such a use case makes sense. And what challenges rigid namespace isolation brings to integration between Kubernetes native services. We will discover how one can construct a solution to this problem.

Quite conversely, many newcomers to Kubernetes find it “too complex”. Why is it, or why is that the impression? After this talk, the audience can make sense out of why Kubernetes does what it does. This by learning the fundamental design philosophies of Kubernetes and cloud native through well-known phenomena and real-world analogies. With the right mental model, hopefully it doesn’t seem overwhelmingly complex anymore.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

      "description": "It seems that every few months we hear about the widespread impact of a major cloud outage. Cloud outages are unpredictable and inevitable; this is what keeps SRE teams up at night. Public cloud remains the most popular data center approach among the cloud native community, with multi-cloud growing in adoption. However, adopting a multi-cloud strategy isn’t as simple as hitting the go button. In this session, we will demonstrate how to deploy a Kubernetes application across clusters in multiple clouds and regions with built-in failover to automatically adapt to cloud outages. You will witness how BGP directs traffic across clusters in a healthy state. Then, we will take one of the clusters offline and show how workloads are automatically rescheduled and traffic is rerouted to healthy clusters in real-time. We will dive into the technologies and logic that are driving this engine and discuss how you can build this type of resilience into your own applications.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

      "description": "The discipline of chaos engineering has evolved since it was introduced by Netflix a decade ago, mostly as a result of the cloud-native paradigm and the proliferation of Kubernetes as the universal control plane for today's distributed architecture. While the essence and basic principles of chaos remains the same, the way it is operationalized has undergone a paradigm shift, not limited to - the faults themselves, the environments where they are executed, the persona carrying out the experiments, as well as the methods to run them. LitmusChaos is a framework that has been designed to address these newer requirements and enable users to proactively identify weaknesses and improve resilience in their cloud-native setup.

      "description": "When you are running OpenTelemetry in production and your services are producing a firehouse of spans, the traditional and default head-based sampling approach won’t cut it. This is because traces are sampled at initiation, which can be useful for some environments, but for larger systems, it can mean you miss out on key trace data. This is where configuring the Collector to sample your traces after they have fully completed–tail-based sampling–becomes a great option. In this talk, you’ll learn about head- and tail-based sampling, and why the latter approach is useful for obtaining the highest level of granularity in troubleshooting. You’ll learn how to configure your OpenTelemetry Collector to do this, and see the implementation in a suite of microservices, with traces exported to Jaeger. You’ll also learn of the current issues with implementing tail-based sampling in the OpenTelemetry Collector in production so you can take the challenges into account for your own deployments.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

      "description": "The Large Hadron Collider is the world’s largest particle accelerator measuring 27 km in circumference. It accelerates beams of particles in opposite directions almost to the speed of light before making them collide. The particles emerging from the collisions are then measured in large detectors such as the Compact Muon Solenoid. An especially important object of study are so-called jets composed of multiple particles shooting out in the same direction from the collision point. Data-driven methods are used to correct the energy values for these jets, and what we’ll present here is the utilization of Kubeflow to enable state-of-the-art graph neural network based corrections. Kubeflow’s pipeline component allows us to define our machine learning workflow in a well-structured and reproducible manner, and its built-in training operators are used to scale up the training with ease. This work is expected to pave the way for future adoption of Kubeflow among the physics community at CERN.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

But, there are still so many exciting frontiers for cloud native to explore. At Huawei, we have been working to push cloud native deployments into the depths of even outer space, to wider scales than ever before, and to higher-level workloads such as AI and machine learning. And, we have been working together with others to broaden the cloud native community.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

In this talk, we will have a look at common mistakes, how corporations place them elf into a twister and why you first need to really understand Netflix, Spotify and co, so that you can understand that you are very much different. Because migrating to the cloud, doesn’t make you native. Feel the passive-aggressive vibes? Good, now we can talk!

Kubernetes audit logs can effectively track the changes made to our clusters. By using Falco, we consume the kernel events and enrich those events with information from Kubernetes. Enabling Kubernetes Audit Logs feature allows us to scan audit events that forwarded from Kubernetes. By using Fluent Bit, we collect logs from different sources such as containers and Falco; furthermore, we extend them with filters, and send them to multiple destinations. By using Loki, we build a highly-available log aggregation system. We create and manage all of our alerting rules for the log data.

TikTok operates a large network of Kubernetes edge clusters around the world, hosting apps such as Tiktok, live and gaming, using cache and traffic acceleration services offered at our edge clusters. The challenge arises when it comes to the deployment management of those edge services on hundreds of edge clusters. Normally, an edge service shares a lot of common configurations when deployed globally, but still has cluster-specific configurations (e.g. resource quota, service hostname, etc.).

Around 2016, the Bink infrastructure team started containerizing their apps. Not long after they migrated to the cloud and moved their apps onto Kubernetes. Still in the early days, they experienced issues with the cloud's unstable networking infrastructure, leading to multiple issues including huge amounts of random TCP disconnects, UDP connections just going missing, and other faults. After a little research, they gave Linkerd a try and, lo and behold, as soon as they started experimenting with it, network faults caused by the instabilities dropped significantly. The timing could not have been better. The team was just starting conversations with Barclays and Linkerd's metrics allowed them to monitor their SLOs and agree to the bank's ambitious latency and success rated based SLAs.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

      "description": "The CNCF Incubated Thanos project with the large open-source community continues to push boundaries regarding observability and monitoring using Prometheus-based metrics. Together with the Prometheus community, it improves the metric story for Kubernetes clusters and beyond. Things like improved performance, better scalability, debuggability, security, metrics backfilling and query QoS is only the tip of the iceberg. As we know, observability nowadays comes in many flavours. Bunching them together is not a trivial side, given many shapes and collection points. Aside from metrics, we have logs, traces or even continuous profiling. In this talk, Kemal and Bartek, Thanos maintainers, after a quick overview of Thanos, will explain how Thanos can be integrated with those non-metric observability signals. The audience will learn an example, end-to-end ways to correlate multiple observability backends with Thanos for enhanced observability and monitoring experience.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

This talk outlines the Thanos community's efforts to improve read path performance through query pushdown and query sharding and how it compares with existing Cortex approaches. Thanos deployment's are composed of stores; components that expose a consistent Prometheus compliant read API for retrieving timeseries, and queriers; components that combine raw timeseries and evaluate PromQL expressions against them. Query pushdown gives the opportunity to pre-evaluate these expressions closer to the data, while query sharding breaks down a query into distinct, disassociated datesets that can be computed concurrently thanks to Kubernetes.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

They will share resources and learning strategies that are beneficial to each. Anecdotal stories about how some real-life, well-known Kubernetes community members got their start will be sprinkled in along the way!

How do you ensure that the proxy is distributed everywhere your software runs? How do you safely upgrade or roll back all those proxies? How can you ensure that your network config is correct - without pushing it to production and risking an outage? Following the GitOps Principles is key to simplifying Service Mesh Operations. Defining the entire service mesh declaratively - be it installation, proxy injection, or configuration - provides a mechanism to safely manage the complexities of a service mesh. Continuously reconciling declarative config with the latest service mesh release keeps you from being caught off-guard by CVEs.

      "description": "We all know we’re running out of IPv4 addresses. Kubernetes introduced the current implementation of dual-stack networking (supporting both IPv4 and IPv6 at the same time) in v1.20, and the dual-stack feature graduated to stable in v1.23. While the world has been slow to adopt IPv6, it is happening. It’s time to learn about using dual-stack to start your own move away from IPv4, supported by changes in Kubernetes components such as pods and services. Join for the discussion as SIG Network members and Kubernetes contributors dive into the technical details underlying the move to dual-stack networking, and leave with recommendations to shape your IPv4/IPv6 rollout strategy.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

      "description": "Within a single cloud provider, accessing secured APIs using your own workload identity is simple. Cloud SDKs used by application developers know how to retrieve identities and credentials from the cloud environment for each workload based on its context. A cloud administrator can then assign permissions to these identities which allow access to the required APIs. This is seamless for developers - simply calling an API in their code just works, while behind the scenes the network call is cryptographically authenticated / authorized. Unfortunately for the user, this identity is cloud-specific. With few alternatives, this often leads to long-lived credentials being mounted into workloads instead. This is less secure and harder to use. This presentation will show an alternative solution which combines features of open source CNCF projects Kubernetes, cert-manager, cert-manager-csi-driver-spiffe, cert-manager-trust and spiffe-connector to expand your SPIFFE trust domain to any cloud.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!",

No matter how much Kubernetes gets easy on its own, making it usable in such context will require a lot of plumbing, workflows, host tuning etc. If you are a telco, like Deutsche Telekom with historically grown multitude of heavily segmented networks with 100s of historically grown overlapping VRFs it is practically mission impossible.
