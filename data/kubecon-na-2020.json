If you choose to access sponsored sessions, you are explicitly consenting to receipt and use of such data by the third-party recipients, which will be subject to their own privacy policies.The greatest barrier to cloud native adoption is security. Microservices, Kubernetes, and cloud computing itself all increase the attack surface of your infrastructure and decrease the administrative controls available to security teams. You can overcome this barrier by designing your architecture around Zero Trust. Zero Trust may sound like a buzzword, but it’s a powerful idea -- instead of creating security perimeters around your services, enable each service to individually authenticate and authorize incoming requests.In this talk we’ll show you how you can secure your cloud native infrastructure with Zero Trust by building a solid foundation with SPIFFE and SPIRE, and then adding OPA, Envoy, and other open source security tools to protect against specific attacks. We’ll show sample architectures from Fortune 500 organizations and examine how they got there.\n",

Far too often we see common vulnerabilities and misconfigurations as the culprit of the latest security incident. Securing critical cloud native applications requires the ability to identify the root causes of these risks and the speed to mitigate them pre-production. In this talk we will cover the processes needed to stay ahead of the bad actors and tools needed to inject security throughout the development lifecycle.1. How security and development teams can succeed together2. Purpose built security tools that embed security checks directly into familiar DevOps tooling3. The scanning of IaC templates, K8's manifests and container images in the CI/CD pipeline4. Enforce zero trust posture and runtime security\n",

Using cloud-native services brings many monitoring challenges. Developers have unique observability requirements to capture data from multiple metric sources from containers, deployment methods.AppDynamics has made significant improvements to automate agent deployment for Kubernetes and non-containerized VM/bare-metal applications to simplify the potentially complex operational and monitoring challenges. Our APM agents offer a full set of features around tracing, dynamic instrumentation, and AI/ML-based root cause analysis.The all-new AppDynamics Kubernetes Cluster agent supports the ability to capture log snippets and associate with container events. Automatically instrument APM for Java, Node.js, and .NET core applications. Learn how the AppDynamics platform can help you focus on application, infrastructure, and cloud insights that directly impact your business the most.Learn more about how to gain full observability of Kubernetes from Jeff Holmes, our resident Kubernetes expert.\n",

For example, even if a critical vulnerability is found, some organizations may accept the risk of it. The policy for vulnerability handling depends on the organization, and in many cases, the person in charge has to make a manual judgement based on this policy every time. This is time-consuming.This talk demonstrates how to automatically handle vulnerabilities detected by a scanner using OPA.- The vulnerabilities found by a scanner in CI are handled automatically by Open Policy Agent- Applying custom policy, OPA shows users which vulnerabilities to addressThis automatic vulnerability handling in CI will be demonstrated live, along with Trivy, which is an open source vulnerability scanner for containers. The same policy handling model could be used with any scanner.\n",

There’s good reason for that. They're both essential for simplifying stateful workloads. Operators make stateful apps approachable, and CSI de-couples upstream Kubernetes and storage systems. Both mean storage innovation is easier and quicker.As a result, attendees might see some interesting names appearing for the first time. DPDK, SPDK, PMEM-CSI, COSI, and TiFlash are just a few that they might stumble across in the schedule. What’s remarkable, is how Operators and CSI are still present and essential for most of the presentations. They’re just becoming a “boring” yet essential part of the stack.In this talk we’ll dive deeper into DPDK and SPDK. They open up some amazing speed potential for OpenEBS (a CNCF Sandbox project). Kubernetes is seeing the “cool” storage tech first, and that’s exciting!\n",

Unfortunately, defining fine-grained security policies early in an SDLC is a much more complex, nuanced and (hopefully) layered endeavor.  To both the developer and the user, security shares neither critical path nor perceived value as new functionality is delivered. Yes, of course everyone cares when there is a breach or an attack or a laptop goes missing. But in ephemeral environments, the more granular the security the more likely it changes. When security changes have more potential to slow development velocity or “take down production”, developers, operations and security are left trying to balance creating, testing \u0026 managing security vs time spent delivering business differentiating value.NeuVector Engineer Tracy Walker examines a single security use case - egress control - and in 15 minutes describes how the granularity and management implemented via Security as Code differs between Kubernetes, Openshift, Istio, and NeuVector.\n",

Rancher CD solves this by creating a git driven engine for applying cluster changes. Declarative code is stored in a git repo. As changes are committed to the repo, linked clusters are automatically updated. Gitops keeps all your clusters consistent, version controlled, and reduces the administrative burden as you scale. Deployment manifests can be defined in Helm, Kustomize or k8s yaml files and can be tailored based on attributes of the target clusters. In this demo, we will walk through getting started with Rancher Continuous Delivery and provide examples of how to leverage this powerful new tool in Rancher 2.5. Topics we’ll cover:1. An overview of Rancher Continuous Delivery2. How to configure cluster groups and tie them to Git repositories3. How to manage deployments on the local cluster4. How to deploy an application across multiple clusters\n",

Many of the infrastructure teams at Salesforce independently chose the Kubernetes mutating admission controller webhook model to dynamically inject sidecars in Kubernetes workloads. This worked well until we realized that each of the teams was writing the same code, debugging the same problems and testing the same code. At that point we took a step back and created a generic way of dealing with injection of sidecars and open sourced it. With very little configuration, any team can create a mutating admission controller without writing any code that works based on annotations and is battle tested. Let's take a look at the demo.\n",

Are we there yet?To some extent there has definitely been some progress. IaaS has abstracted how we work with VMs, and Kubernetes has abstracted how we manage containers - but in many cases the complexities of the underlying infrastructure are not just still visible but \"in your face\". And, not all of these issue are simply a matter of a nicer UX either.There has been some recent advances made though, and in this session we'll explore what some of the challenges are that people are facing, and what work has been done to help us get closer to our goal of letting developers be developers, not infrastructure experts.\n",

Those artifacts didn’t stop with ancient periods; they build in communities of the present, even open source communities like ours. Some of these are in git repos spread across the org, others in our hearts. Our most well known cultural artifact, the Kubernetes heptagon and wheel logo, has several stories that many of you have already heard, we’ll build on those and more in this talk.In 15 minutes, Nikhita and Paris from Kubernetes Steering Committee will tell a story of the last five years of artifacts that have been created and impacted the most by its contributors.\n",

For example, sampled tracing may leave errors or unusual latency sampled out and missed.In this talk, Wish Shi and Zhenchi Zhong will share their experience in implementing a high-performance OpenTracing-compatible tracing library, which was originally created for TiKV. The library can trace events under nanoseconds latency without sampling on the modern x64 architecture.

In an environment like Kubernetes where the Pods get created and deleted left, right, and centre, if an application hasn't implemented signal handling correctly, ungraceful termination of that application is most likely to happen and it could lead to disrupted services. For running the containers in a reliable fashion with proper signal handling and lifecycle management, there are a few strategies that should be followed which this talk would be covering: ~ Signal handling through `init` system - covers PID 1, orphans and zombie processes, Linux signals, `dumb-init` or `tini`. ~ Utilizing postStart and preStop lifecycle hooks for initialization and graceful termination. ~ Liveness, Readiness, and Startup probes. ~ Key differences between the postStart hook, initContainer, and Startup Probe.\n",

The community channeled herculean efforts towards the enhancement of developer experience by extending the cluster CLI, building portals, and highly-responsive UIs. This talk will focus on the cluster DX chronicles, showcasing tools which contributed to wider adoption for Kubernetes. An emphasis will be placed on cluster CLI and how it can be extended using kubectl plugins and wrappers. This will be followed by an introduction of widespread cluster state managers, covering mechanisms such as GitOps, ClickOps, and even SheetOps.\n",

The quest for the ultimate Kubernetes homelab brings all the components of DevOps and infrastructure management for a homelab nirvana.\n",

      "description": "\n  Distributed DL training requires high performance networks connecting tens, hundreds, or for certain natural language processing models, even thousands of GPUs. Running these workloads on Kubernetes clusters of GPU enhanced servers requires careful engineering to avoid bottlenecks at NIC and switching fabric that act as interconnect between nodes. In this presentation we will describe the design and architecture of a 800 GPU cluster interconnected over RoCE fabric to achieve line rate performance between communicating containers in a multi-node job. Some of the topics we will cover are scalable cookie-cutter POD design for DC, low latency one hop network design that enables NCCL rings to avoid output port congestion and K8s integration with a multi-homed network for optimal GPU utilization. We will share performance numbers for training workloads from our production clusters.\n",

Indeed serverless computing architecture is all about using events and functions to integrate cloud services together. The world is not so much without servers, they are definitely still there somewhere, but the world is now full of services. The cloud has become our kernel, it is made of a myriad of API exposing cloud services, our world has become servicefull and not serverless. With this difference exposed we will discuss how k8s extensions can help us integrate services and move towards servicefull applications.\n",

Bring them together and there are... problems: Go does a brilliant job of caching both source module dependencies and binary artifacts. When building Go in docker containers, while there are hacks to get source dependencies into the Docker cache, all the binary artifacts still have to be rebuilt, greatly increasing build times. And what happens when you need to work on some of the dependencies of the repo you are docker building? There's no good answer. What about debugging and testing? Go has fantastic debugging and testing tools, but there's no clear simple pattern for using them when doing Docker based development. This talk provides clear, simple, battle tested patterns for solving these problems in ways that are both Go-like and Docker-like.

Unlike older OCR tech, the new application does not use pre-defined markers such as “name,” “phone number,” or “address” to extract information. Instead, it works by recognizing these fields using machine learning – even if the ML model has not been trained with a document/picture of that type. The audience will learn how to create and scale serverless functions and Kubernetes. In addition, we will demonstrate how to leverage AutoML to read documents/pictures from any source, classify and extract fields of interest using a pre-trained ML model, store information to a NoSQL database.\n",

There were good times. There were rough times. And throughout, we had to continually ask ourselves what exactly we were trying to build. In the aftermath of Helm 3, we have reached new levels of clarity about where we want to go, and how we want to build a tool that continues to serve the needs of the Kubernetes community.\n",

The Telecom User Group (TUG) is a user group for telecom operators, vendors, and developers to share ideas and ask questions about using cloud native technologies. The CNF Testbed is a set of tools and reference implementations used for reviewing cloud native technology innovation in the Telecom domain. The CNF Conformance is a test suite to self-validate that Cloud native Network Functions (CNFs) and the underlying Telecom platforms adhere to cloud native principles and best practices. This session will introduce these Telecom Initiatives, explain how downstream projects and communities can collaborate, and discuss how service providers and their vendors can get involved.\n",

Software-Defined WAN (SD-WAN) technologies have democratized access patterns across the Internet through latency reduction, throughput improvement, and packet loss prevention. However, integration between SD-WAN and K8s is still an emerging field, despite the automation opportunities. This talk shows how to link K8s application attributes with SD-WAN network capabilities. The recently open-sourced Cloud-Native SD-WAN (CNWAN) K8s Operator offers a reference implementation for how SD-WAN controllers can use K8s application metadata to optimize application WAN traffic. This talk discusses developer workflows for deploying K8s-hosted apps defining WAN attributes and patterns for publishing those apps via service discovery systems as an interface for SD-WAN controllers.\n",

Service-level-objective (SLO) is the key to run large-scale production cluster reliably. Defining SLOs for classic web services is simple, since web requests are served synchronously with distinct status code. On the contrast, defining SLOs for Kubernetes services is obscured due to its intent-oriented design and declarative APIs. This talk first briefs the philosophy behind the SLO-driven approach for reliability engineering, followed by a deep dive of how SREs define SLOs for one of the world largest Kubernetes cluster in Ant Financial. Finally this talk shares concrete cases and lessons learned of building SLOs framework from several perspectives, including monitoring, alerting and tracing.\n",

It has brought the industry together in consensus about the best practices in storage. CSI only supports Block and File storage. Object storage is a fundamentally different paradigm where data is accessed over the network rather than locally. It allows applications to remain stateless, while offloading state into a blackbox over the network. Object storage is the key enabler for cloud migration. This paradigm however, does not have a standard mechanism for consumption in Kubernetes. In this talk, we discuss our efforts in bringing object storage into the forefront of kubernetes and introduce the Container Object Storage Interface (COSI) and cover: - Need for COSI - Best practices for using COSI - Designing apps to leverage COSI\n",

These protocols are used across a variety of domains, from IoT to gaming to telephony and more. In order to build cloud native services with these protocols, we need to understand how and where networking protocols are supported to uncover roadblocks preventing new applications in domains like IoT \u0026 gaming.

      "description": "\n  If you purchased a Keynote-Only Pass, please watch the keynote on the LFX Event Dashboard.Modern cloud native developers use APIs and services from a variety of organic, public cloud and SaaS offers to build their apps and drive velocity. Unfortunately, this implies that the developer, security teams, infrastructure teams, the responsible SREs, and the management chain (e.g., CISOs) are out-of-sync and in the dark on the security ramifications behind any developer’s API choices. And worse, they have no visibility to the security exposure of the app's customers and their data.This talk will highlight these challenges due to the velocity mismatch between these teams, the potential lack of compliance, and the risk to customer data due to these API decisions. We will explore how solving it earlier in the application development lifecycle will lower the cost of the exposure of the entire software (and hardware) stack as well as what needs to be done in the community to solve these problems in a software-driven manner.

At the same time, to a novice developer trying to break into distributed systems, Kubernetes can also be incredibly daunting at times. Kube-netc was a project developed by Drew Ripberger, a recent high school graduate turned summer intern at Nirmata. Kube-netc is built around creating all encompassing network observability. With eBPF capturing connection statistics and Prometheus exposing the processed metrics, kube-netc is a compelling example of how users can easily implement enhanced system awareness. Though prior to his internship, Drew had not used Kubernetes, or even heard of eBPF or Prometheus before getting assigned the project, this talk will take you through the creation of kube-netc and his journey from hacks and workarounds to utilizing everything that the CNCF ecosystem has to offer.\n",

It aggregates compute resources from around the world. While that's impressive, there are issues that a single cluster cannot solve: in this case, decentralized governance. PRP participants delegate the control of some of their compute resources to UCSD. That wouldn't scale to a global network of independent institutions. So PRP, along with peer projects nationwide, decided to adopt Admiralty's open-source multi-cluster scheduler, which allows for decentralized control plane topologies. Dmitry will demo the federation of Nautilus with the clusters of other large scientific networks; Adrien will explain how Admiralty implemented Virtual Kubelet and the Kubernetes scheduler framework to make this possible.\n",

Where Kubernetes API offers many knobs for tuning your workloads, using CRI-O gives you access to even more. CRI-O is a container runtime that provides an incubation space for new runtime features in a secure way. It exposes lower-level features with container annotations, runtime classes, and configuration variables, giving admins control over how and when these features are available, and paving a path for their eventual stabalization and wider adoption in Kubernetes. Join the CRI-O maintainers Peter Hunt, Sascha Grunert, Urvashi Mohnani and Mrunal Patel as they give an introduction of CRI-O and walk through the features and knobs CRI-O exposes.\n",

Think big data, storage, analytics, 5G, virtual network functions, then encrypt it all at 40Gbps line rates. Kubernetes and the Kubernetes network model are increasingly seen as essential to help manage these workloads at scale. But the cost of containerization and container networking can be hard to swallow for workloads that are often used to having dedicated NICs and physical hardware. Our novel solution was to cook up a feast that is a fusion of two worlds: combining Calico, the popular cloud native Kubernetes network plugin, with VPP, a very fast and scalable userspace packet processing software.

This talk introduces how to automate this allocation by using the \"WaitForFirstConsumer\" volume binding mode and tuning kube-scheduler. The use of \"WaitForFirstConsumer\" translates the problem of storage allocation into that of pod scheduling. Kenji and his colleagues in Cybozu utilize the feature of Topology Spread Constraints to distribute storage pods. They found that kube-scheduler needs tuning from the default to spread pods optimally under disturbance such as CPU consuming workloads. Since kube-scheduler is being improved, the tuning method varies according to the Kubernetes version. The talk covers the tuning methods for Kubernetes 1.17, 1.18, and 1.19. By distributing storage pods among racks, they achieved fault tolerance against a full rack failure.\n",

To handle this scale, over the years Intuit has experimented with different config management approaches including templating (Helm), overlays (Kustomize), codifying and abstracting (jsonnet, cdk8s), ultimately settling on Kustomize. Kustomize’s remote base capabilities allow our central team to define and distribute standard patterns and templates, while still allowing developers to overlay last-mile customizations on these templates.

In this talk, Yuan Chen and Yan Xu will present their experience and results of leveraging the Kubernetes scheduling framework and developing new plugins to create a custom scheduler. The scheduler can meet different scheduling needs of diverse workloads in large scale clusters, from stateless to stateful services, big data jobs and machine learning applications. They will deep dive into (1) the design and implementation of the scheduling plugins for performance optimization, custom pod placement and group scheduling, and (2) the use of plugins and scheduling profiles to achieve a better balance between scheduling performance and quality. New features and enhancements of the scheduling framework will also be discussed.\n",

BERT requires significant compute during inference, which poses challenges for real-time application performance. KFServing provides a simple model serving interface across common model servers with a standardized REST/gRPC inference protocol to serve single or co-located multiple models on CPU or GPU. KFServing enables hardware acceleration and autoscaling of Bloomberg's own BERT models trained on a corpora of specialized, financial news data. In this talk, we will discuss how we use KFServing in a production application to address scalability, latency, and throughput with Knative’s Autoscaler and Activator. We will also discuss some performance debugging tips and show the GPU benchmark results with TensorFlow/PyTorch BERT models deployed to KFServing.\n",

Canary releases, Dark launches, A/B testing, Blue-Green mirroring) meant to reduce the risk of introducing new software versions in production. In this session, Stefan will talk about what it takes to adopt progressive delivery for Kubernetes and how Flagger and service meshes can make deployments safer by limiting the impact of a failed release. We will look at different progressive delivery techniques, discuss the pros and cons, suggest what type of applications are best suited for each technique, and review added complexities that come with each option. We’ll close with a live demo of a GitOps pipeline powered by Flux, Flagger, and Linkerd to showcase the deployment techniques presented.\n",

ML systems are complex and differ from traditional software systems; as such unique challenges arise when engineers or data scientists try to integrate and continuously operate ML systems in production. Applying best practices and principles from DevOps to machine learning systems (MLOps) can help practitioners navigate the entire ML lifecycle. In this talk, we will share our experience so far in applying MLOps to a computer vision use case at Snapchat. We will walkthrough the process of transforming a manual script driven process into a more robust and automated experience. We will describe our ML pipeline and how we leveraged Kubernetes, Kubeflow pipelines, and Spinnaker to achieve continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous training.\n",

      "description": "\n  As Kubernetes clusters grew to span multiple zones and regions, it became clear that we needed to improve network routing. The initial kube-proxy implementation meant that all requests were equally likely to go to any endpoint, regardless of how far away it was. With topology aware routing, kube-proxy will attempt to keep network traffic within the same zone or region if there is sufficient capacity. This can have huge impacts on network efficiency, performance, and scalability. This talk will cover the evolution of topology aware routing in Kubernetes including the options that didn’t end up working. It will demonstrate how the current algorithm works, discuss the tradeoffs of the approach, and show the simulations that were run to develop the algorithm. Finally, this talk will provide some data showing the significant impacts this feature can have on Kubernetes networking.\n",

      "description": "\n  At its heart, Kubernetes is an infrastructure platform: It abstracts at the infrastructure layer, but does little to resolve application layer dependencies. Today, a Kubernetes application cannot be defined and deployed uniformly across multiple platforms without modification, because its definitions depend on specific platform implementation. For example, one platform might choose Nginx as the ingress solution, while another might choose Traefik. To solve this problem, we need a standard application model to bridge the gap between application and infrastructure. This talk introduces Open Application Model (OAM) which enables developers to build and deploy k8s applications in a platform-agnostic way. We will look at how it approaches the problem and how it leverages cloud services and open source projects to facilitate standardized application development across multiple environments.\n",

Many online services need to dynamically increase the resource limit during operation, and cannot accept the impact of restart.Other applications may require NUMA awareness, CPU Core binding, reduce data copy between CPU caches, and speed up data processing tasks.We have developed a combined scheduling system based on Kubernetes Scheduler framework and Cgroups controller. The scheduler perceives cgroups level resources, such as numa, cpu core, memory limit, etc., and applies scheduler dynamic scheduling to specified nodes, while allowing certain Pod is bound to the specified cpu core. The cgroups controller can also dynamically adjust the pod resources limit without causing the Pod to restart.\n",

Recently, serverless computing has been touted as the panacea for elastic compute that can provide flexibility and lower operating costs. However, for ML, the need to precisely define hardware configurations and long warm-up times of certain ML models exacerbate the limitations of serverless. To provide the best solution to our customers, we have run extensive benchmarking experiments comparing the performance of serverless and traditional computing for inference workloads running on Kubernetes (with KubeFlow and with the ModelDB MLOps Toolkit). Our experiments have spanned a variety of model types, data modalities, hardware, and workloads. In this talk, we present the results from our benchmarking study and provide a guide to architect your own k8s-based ML inference system.\n",

An attacker can potentially include corrupt policies and data in the bundle and OPA would end-up enforcing those policies, thereby compromising the entire system. In this talk, we will describe how OPA can assist in the secure distribution of policies and data by creating a “Signed Bundle” - a bundle that is digitally signed so that industry-standard cryptographic primitives can verify its authenticity.

      "description": "\n  Serverless platforms increasingly provide support for function composition (e.g., Knative Eventing, Fission, KNIX). To reduce function interaction overhead within a workflow, platforms may choose to co-locate multiple functions inside a single container along with a custom local messaging mechanism. In this design, the functions of a complex workflow may have to be partitioned across multiple containers, requiring invocations to a downstream function to be load-balanced between its replicas across containers. Service meshes could provide such load balancing; however, they lack locality awareness for the workflow. This talk explores how service meshes can be extended to be co-location aware and to provide a single data plane for both intra- and inter-container messaging. Lessons learned implementing such a co-location aware data plane, its advantages and pitfalls are also presented.\n",

      "description": "\n  In early 2020 HEB was rated as the #1 grocery retailer in the country in a consumer survey run by Dunnnhumby. As shelter in place orders were implemented as COVID-19 spread across the world, H-E-B Curbside \u0026 Delivery became a critical resource for Texans. The HEB Digital Fulfillment team had already been hard at work building features for their legacy monolithic application and, at the same time, migrating workloads to Kubernetes. The team needed to accelerate the completion of their new services to ensure healthy and reliable H-E-B fulfillment capabilities, as well as build confidence for rolling these services out to Curbside locations by using Linkerd metrics. In this presentation, members of the HEB team will describe how they use Linkerd to secure, scale, and monitor their microservices applications to deliver high quality service as traffic increases across their site\n",

Alex has been building clusters with Docker and Raspberry Pis since 2015 and has published dozens of articles, tutorials, and even software tools to support the ecosystem. He recently published “5 years of RPi Docker Clusters” on raspberrypi.org and this talk takes you through the journey. Find out what Apple Silicon and AWS Graviton have in common with this tiny System-on-a-Chip computer - and why they are so important to its future. Learn how you can add support for all of the above devices to your own open source projects. So is an RPi cluster just for gathering dust, getting retweets, and upvotes on Hacker News, or can it also serve a real purpose? Come to this talk and find out, along with live demos.\n",

Many best practices are already applied, increasing their safety: unit/e2e testing, code reviews and post mortem analysis. This talk introduces some more recent tooling for working developers toolbox: model checkers. The likes of TLA+ and alloy have already been used for helping design many real-world systems, from S3 all the way to RTOS (real-time operating system) with massive success. They allow us to design and model our systems in the abstract, state the system facts, assumptions and expected rules to hold, and finally, they analyze our model for inconsistencies or scenarios we haven't thought of - like code review for system design on steroids. This talk introduces model checkers, covers the motivation behind them, and finishes with a short example.\n",

True, it involves continuous delivery (CD), but the way delivery is achieved as well as how CD interacts with workload operations, that is where GitOps gets really interesting. True, part of GitOps is leveraging Git abstractions like branches, pull requests and approval flows to manage the operational process, but GitOps is far more than the last step of CI. Instead it is about leveraging the most fundamental element of Kubernetes, reconciliation, both for CD and to link CD with the reconcilers that are automating workload operations. In this session Cornelia will cover the four key principles of GitOps, and she’ll demo those concepts with specific tools including Flux. She’ll also talk about use cases including cluster-api (CAPI).\n",

Low latency, performance and higher throughput become prerequisites to ensure that the edge is a viable location for heavy duty applications. There is a growing trend of building new K8s clusters on bare-metal infrastructure, eliminating the need to deploy hypervisors for hardware abstraction. Better performance at scale can be attributed to K8s enhancements in resource management and accelerated networking. SmartNICs bring further opportunities for packet processing. By offloading more operations to the NIC, we free up resources on the host enabling us to further accelerate the processing capabilities of the entire platform. With these offloads, edge computing can reach its full potential and become a desired choice for high-performance workloads.\n",

Typically thought of as centralized and monolithic, they now play a key role in service and events orchestration and coordination. With many different architecture approaches already in place, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation has started an initiative to specify Serverless Workflows Specification to ensure portability and vendor neutrality. In this talk, we introduce the CNCF Serverless Workflow specification and provide examples and demos running on Kubernetes and Kogito, Red Hat’s business automation toolkit. You will learn: * The what, why, and how of the CNCF Serverless Workflow specification * Why using the Serverless Workflow specification and orchestration can improve your serverless architecture * Define and deploy Serverless Workflow custom resources on Kubernetes\n",

      "description": "\n  Seccomp is a system call filtering tool built into Linux. It has been used as a security layer in Docker for coming up to five years, and is working through a long path to become on by default in Kubernetes. We look at what seccomp can usefully do to improve real world security, and how best to use it. This talk also covers a reworking of the widely used Docker default seccomp policy, based on experience of security vulnerabilities in the last five years. Seccomp can both be used as a policy in a runtime, and also directly by applications, so both aspects are covered. The policy has also caused a number of usability issues over the years, so we look at the pitfalls involved in using it as syscalls change over time.\n",

Nick Santos and the Tilt team tried to build a tool that traced the effects of each apply. He’ll tell stories about several attempts to propagate and assign blame across state changes. Most of them failed! Or broke Kubernetes updates in frustrating ways! Along the way, they learned about labels, informers, UIDs, owner refs, events, and how kubectl apply works internally.

In this session, we will describe the challenges associated with reconciling Kubernetes objects from a source of truth to arbitrary clusters, and how to solve those challenges. Aside from challenges, we will discuss the tradeoffs that can be made, especially in domain-specific designs. Expect to walk away with a better understanding of the challenges involved in running multiple clusters, knowledge of existing tools and techniques, and an idea of how upstream developers approach the problem space.\n",

The performance degradation often happens as new metrics are introduced with more instances or deploys and a working query may break all of a sudden. In this talk, we will show you how slow queries can be preemptively detected and automatically sped up without any manual reconfiguration. We detail two approaches to achieving automated speed ups - one that is based on recording rules and the other is based on the M3 Aggregation tier. We will compare and contrast both approaches and show examples of how one can leverage either open source method to achieve the same results.\n",

Each of these environments has different security and compliance requirements, such as PCI and FedRAMP. We must deal with evolving requirements as our tenants pursue new accreditations. While we could implement a variety of mutating and validating webhook implementations to meet our needs, we instead turned to Open Policy Agent (OPA). OPA has allowed us to quickly develop and deploy new policies as these requirements shift and evolve. In this talk, we will look at several concrete examples of how we used OPA to implement our changing kubernetes policy requirements and help our tenants achieve a variety of compliance certifications, while at the same time striving to make these security policies as unobtrusive to their existing CI/CD pipelines and workflows.\n",

      "description": "\n  The advent of edge computing has led to the trend of splitting applications into edge and cloud components, which makes service mesh a great fit to enable unified application network policies for inter-container communications, regardless of where individual microservice is deployed. However, service mesh projects such as Istio are mostly designed for large scale deployment, and some features, such as per pod sidecar, may be ill-suited for inherently more resource constrained edge. And optimizing the use of WAN connection is mostly missing. The talk centers on Clovisor, a project aimed to extend service mesh to the edge. By utilizing eBPF, SDWAN, and Envoy, Clovisor performs functions such as translating service mesh app network policies to edge/cloud network policies, redirecting traffic to proxy on edge, classifying and mapping application flows to WAN connectivity tunnels.\n",

      "description": "\n  Currently the API Server has no concept of priority or fairness for requests. This means that a buggy webhook or bad actor can potentially DOS an API Server by sending lots of requests. This also means that currently the API Server cannot prioritize more important traffic when subjected to high load.This session will introduce the architecture of the APIPriorityAndFairnesss feature for Kubernetes which aims to solve these issues. Using the feature, administrators can categorize API Server requests into various priority levels and flows within each priority level, allocating concurrency to each priority level and getting fairness between the flows of a priority level.This talk is targeted at Kubernetes developers and SREs who are interested in the new features to help prevent API Server downtime as well as those wanting API Server request limits for multi-tenancy.\n",

      "description": "\n  When managing artifacts like container images and Helm charts for cloud native apps, users often face challenges such as efficiently publishing applications to Kubernetes cluster at scale, enforcing access control, identifying image vulnerabilities and backing up cloud native artifacts.In this talk, we introduce real-world use cases for managing images and Helm charts in CI/CD pipeline and production environment. The cases are summarized from production users of Kubernetes, including these aspects:1. Setting up a highly available and scale-out registry service for a Kubernetes cluster2. Synchronizing images and Helm charts of cloud native applications across multiple cloud environments or data centers3. Preventing images with vulnerabilities from getting into production4. Using P2P approach to efficiently distribute images in a large cluster5. Integrated management in CI/CD\n",

      "description": "\n  The Open Policy Agent (OPA) has become widely used in the CNCF ecosystem and is a go-to option for application developers as the standardized decision engine for authorization. Many users rely on the existing integrations with Envoy/Istio, or the OPA REST API Server, but this doesn't always fit in an application cleanly. Common performance questions arise related to using the OPA HTTP API, plus management concerns around collecting decision logs, and requirements for integration with existing security infrastructure. Join Patrick East, an active OPA maintainer, to see how easy it is to use OPA's public Golang API's to create a tailored OPA binary with the following extensions: * Custom High Performance gRPC font-end API * Custom Kafka decision log plugin * Custom OAuth2 Rego builtin functions\n",
