It's modular, reusable, and super shareable, making it easy to get up-and-running fast. Because it's so user-friendly, however, IaC is often subject to security and compliance misconfigurations that can make their way to production resources and workloads.The key to preventing that from happening is adopting policy-as-code and scanning for misconfigurations continuously throughout the development lifecycle.In this technical demo, we'll show how Bridgecrew enables exactly that for Kubernetes manifests, Terraform, CloudFormation, and more. You'll see Bridgecrew's complete codified cloud security suite in action—our IDE extension, pre-commit hooks, version control and CI/CD integrations, and runtime scanning.\n",

The pandemic has accelerated this journey and hybrid-multi cloud is now a foundation of modern enterprise architectures. Along the way, you’ve become comfortable optimizing for where, when, and how your applications run. So, why wouldn’t you be equally comfortable using distributed storage that: • Provides location transparency for all your stateful applications • Runs anywhere SDS for predictable enterprise-grade resilience, scale, and performance delivered in an application-aware model• Integrates natively with K8s and your existing workflows Containerization promises application portability, yet legacy infrastructure relies on traditional snapshot and replication technology to migrate data across locations, becoming a bottleneck for modern DevOps environments. With distributed storage, you can provision cloud-native, programmable storage when you need it with self-service access and know that your data is instantly available across multiple locations (edge, core, clouds) using our distributed architecture. In this session, you will see distributed storage in action in a K8s environment and learn how to:• Easily setup and manage persistent volumes using our new Commvault Distributed Storage Operator • Establish enterprise-grade high availability for stateful applications across regions and zones• Benefit from the simplicity and efficiency of sharing the same storage across multiple OpenShift and K8s clustersModern solutions don’t come from bolt-ons to legacy technology – they come from a foundational architecture rooted in multi-hybrid cloud distribution. \n",

There is a set of great tools available for visualizing “current” state of the cluster. But often times, live site incidents are mitigated and root cause analysis is left for later. This becomes particularly challenging for incidents that happen due to various K8s events since these events are only available for one hour on the cluster. After this, the only way to debug what happened is by correlating various logs and timelines from control plane, hence making it harder to root cause (increases MTRR). Sloop provides a one stop shop solution with a single pane of glass by showing historic view of cluster. In this demo, we will be sharing the top real incidents for which we found the root cause in a matter of minutes using Sloop.\n",

You have to build the right dockerfile and container image and create various Kubernetes objects, like deployments, services, replicas, and horizontal pod autoscalers. And this is an iterative process with several testing and validation checkpoints along the way. Sound complex? It sure is.In this demo, you’ll learn how to simplify and automate this with Cloud Native Buildpacks and Knative. Cloud Native Buildpacks figure out the language your code is written in, determine the best way to package the code, and build an OCI-compliant container image. And Knative takes that image and automatically generates the required configuration to create deployments, services, and automated pod scalers.\n",

      "description": "\n  Have you ever inherited a system? If you ever feel unclear the system's purpose, it's time to break it down into first principles. With so many Cloud Native tools available it can be overwhelming to decide which tools are most directly solving the problem (or could solve it). We will take a systematic approach to enumerating and grouping core issues and how the related tools solve them. We start with a review of core operating concepts, basic data and network models. From there we contrast OS level solutions to these problems and their challenges. We next enter the Cloud Native layer and see how they leverage OS level concepts to solve these problems. Finally, we compare potential solutions to core issues at different levels (OS or Cloud Native). This talk is focused on how to break down tools into functional areas and contrast them to each other. Leaving this session you will have more techniques to reason about these tools and model solutions.\n",

From databases to data protection applications, the cloud-native landscape is littered with projects that backup data to object storage. With all this mission-critical data being stored in object storage it’s no wonder that it’s become a high-value target for cyber criminals. This, in combination with the rising popularity of cryptocurrency, means that ransomware protection is now a requirement for IT departments of any size.The S3 protocol has become the de-facto standard API for interacting with Object Storage. It is implemented by nearly all object storage providers and consumed by modern cloud native applications. Thankfully it provides all the primitives needed to develop a robust strategy to protect against ransomware attacks.In this session, we’ll walk through how backups saved in an S3-compatible can be made ransomware resistant. We’ll show which APIs are used and how to configure the buckets. If you’re considering backing up data in object storage and your data is too valuable to lose, then this talk is for you!\n",

As a result, multiple areas have developed in the industry, galvanizing solutions for components such as runtime, tracing, metrics, service mesh, and many more. However, to accommodate the expanding space of cloud-native tooling, it was necessary to introduce standardization and guidelines to simplify the interoperability and consumption of these tools. This talk will focus on the evolution of open standards and manifestos within the cloud-native landscape, including OCI, OpenTelemetry, Open Service Mesh, Open Application Model, and many more.

This principle works for any platform including Kubernetes.One of the timeless rules that can effectively address any failure scenario is called the3-2-1 backup rule. This approach helps to answer two important questions: How many backup files should I have and where should I store them?There are two groups of people: those who have already had a storage failure andthose who will have one in the future. In other words, the 3-2-1 backup rule means you should:- Have at least three copies of your data.- Store the copies on two different media.- Keep one backup copy offsite.\n",

RocksDB supports TTL natively but with a limitation that all keys should be of the same TTL. This may cause inconvenience for developers who may have the demand to set different TTL for each key. This issue happens to TiKV, a distributed key value database built on RocksDB with Raft. To solve it, TiKV team achieved more flexible TTL support in TiKV level instead of using RocksDB’s TTL. In this talk, Bokang Zhang will walk through the TiKV architecture and talk about how they supported TTL in TiKV by leveraging the hook of RocksDB’s compaction filter and user defined properties, and how they made the disk space of TTL key-values recycled in time.\n",

On top of that, dealing with various workflows to customize and deploy applications can pose even more of a challenge. No single Kubernetes tool is going to solve everyone’s problem, and as an operator you might be forced to use multiple kubernetes tools to manage a single Kubernetes cluster. But then there’s no guarantee that these tools are going to work well together seamlessly.Carvel is a suite of open-source projects that aims to solve these problems. It provides a set of reliable, single-purpose, composable tools that aid in your application building, packaging, configuration, and deployment to Kubernetes. Carvel enables users to get software installed and keep it updated on a Kubernetes cluster in a secure, scalable, and automated way.In this session, João Pereira and Helen George will explore how the whole suite of Carvel tools (ytt, kbld, kapp, imgpkg, kapp-controller) work and show how you can integrate them for managing packages on Kubernetes. We’ll look at a few concrete examples where Carvel can be used as a part of your toolchain together with Helm Charts, kustomize and http library.\n",

In almost every organization, there are services like databases and legacy workloads that are outside Kubernetes, but that still have to communicate with Kubernetes workloads. Doing this securely is a challenge, since the methods that are available within a cluster to provide secure connections aren’t available outside it. The CNCF’s SPIRE project is the solution: it can help you establish secure service identities across your organization, regardless of the platform they are running in.

      "description": "\n  In 2016, Alex Polvi at CoreOS coined the term “GIFEE” (Google’s Infrastructure for Everyone Else) to describe the benefits unlocked by containers at scale: agility, secure, efficiency, and reliability. Five years in, the cloud native vision has thrived beyond the wildest of imaginations.  So what’s next for GIFEE? In a word: hardware. While cloud native software and management practices have proliferated, “next level” innovation increasingly depends on having specialized hardware in the right place at the right time. At GIFEE Day, we’ll look at the future of cloud native from an infrastructure lens: from provisioning and securing to monitoring and optimizing.GIFEE Day is complimentary for all KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 attendees. We’ll have 8 great livestream sessions from diverse community members hosted by Equinix Metal.View the GIFEE Day schedule on the event website!How to Register: Registration for GIFEE Day is now closed!For questions regarding this event, please reach out to tcrowe@equinix.com.\n",

We believe it’s all that and more, but while it’s here and immensely capable, it alas can still be hard, inconsistent, \u0026 incomplete. Choice paralysis, trepidation at the prospect of vendor lock-in, and concern about availability of the skillsets required remain challenges for many. And how do you equip it to provide the right set of services and qualities for all manner of applications, both those originally cloud-native and those that started elsewhere and have evolved? So, it’s 2021 and we’ve learned a few things along the way. Let’s talk about how to navigate and operate to wield the true power of Kubernetes whether you’re a virtuoso or perhaps one of the rest of us.\n",

But in the end, none of these solutions have come close to the popularity of industry-standard virtualization products like vSphere and Nutanix.We believe the reason is, despite Kubernetes becoming an industry standard, knowledge of it is not widespread among VM administrators. They are familiar with concepts like ISO images, disk volumes, NICs, and VLANS – not concepts like pods and PVCs.Project Harvester is an open-source alternative to traditional proprietary hyperconverged (HCI) infrastructure software, built on top of Kubernetes. Harvester is designed to be easy to understand, install and operate, even without the knowledge of Kubernetes.In this session, Sheng will talk about the motivation of building Harvester, explain the architecture, and show a demo of the latest release.\n",

Often this has meant a choice between using a managed database, or taking on the task of deploying and managing a distributed database on Kubernetes. Apache Cassandra™ is a powerful database used in many applications that require resilience and scalability, but has traditionally been challenging to deploy and manage effectively on Kubernetes. Now the Kubernetes and Cassandra communities have come together in a great collaboration called K8ssandra, a production-ready platform that makes it easy to run Cassandra™ on Kubernetes.In this workshop, you will learn how to deploy and manage a data tier based on Apache Cassandra™ cluster in Kubernetes using K8ssandra. We’ll explore activities using hands-on exercises, that include:- Creating a K8ssandra release using Helm- Using a benchmarking tool (NoSQLBench) to generate read/write load on the database- Monitoring database performance through metrics and alerts- Breaking nodes in the database cluster on purpose to observe how Cassandra self-heals- Scaling the database up and down- Deploying applications on top of the database using CQL and REST APIs- Backing up and restoring dataPresented byAleks Volochnev, DataStaxJeff Carpenter, DataStaxHow to Register: Registration is now CLOSED for Running a Cloud-Native Data Tier with K8ssandra!For questions regarding this event, please reach out to jessica.benton@datastax.com.\n",

      "description": "\n  During COVID, Peloton experienced exponential growth. Countless customers flocked to the company’s at-home fitness experience, and membership grew from 1 million to more than 4 million people. To continue delivering an experience that positively impacted the physical, mental and emotional wellbeing of these new and existing Members, the Peloton team tapped into the CNCF community and cloud native technologies, helping them accommodate this exponential growth. During this time, Peloton moved 100% of its traffic to the Kubernetes orchestration to make hypergrowth easier and more efficient. It leveraged other cloud native projects such as ArgoCD, Fluentd and the OpenTelemetry observability framework to innovate faster across a wide range of engineering disciplines. In this keynote, Jim Haughwout, Peloton’s VP of Platform, will share how Peloton engineers leveraged cloud native technology to unlock transformational growth for the company, while growing the engineering team itself by 300% in the midst of the pandemic. Haughwout will also share how Peloton will harness cloud native technologies and the power of community to boost the experience of engineers across multiple domains, unlocking further growth with the rise of IoT, streaming, edge, mobile, cloud-native, AI, and ML. \n",

Documentation that lives in her repository, together with her code. Documentation that becomes discoverable automatically, to all engineers within the organization. Documentation in one single place: Backstage. This talk will guide you through how we fulfilled Emma’s big goal by adopting the “docs like code” approach and developing TechDocs, one of the core features of Backstage.

Despite its many advantages, the cloud native CD ecosystem has its challenges. This session will discuss issues arising from the lack of interoperability across proliferating cloud native CD technologies. We will look at end user case studies, including existing integration initiatives such as that between Tekton and Jenkins X.

      "description": "\n  As the complexity of our software systems grows – and they ingest more and more dependencies to deliver their functionality – the supply chain becomes more complex, and thus more difficult to secure. The industry is forming a consensus around a baseline set of properties for a secure software supply chain, yet these are not enough to protect against some of the high-profile attacks we have seen in recent years. In some cases they may not even have made detection easier. The industry needs to do better, we need to do better. An attacker who compromises a software supply chain can greatly increase the blast radius of their attack to all eventual users of the system. In some cases the exploits are overlooked or unintended bugs; some others have been known to be more deliberate and insidious (most recently, SunBurst/Solarigate).This presentation shares the experience of the CNCF SIG-Security Supply Chain Working Group with particular attention to intricacies and sharp edges of the practice of creating and maintaining a tightly-secured software supply chain.\n",

At Adobe Experience Manager Cloud Service we built solutions to provide customers with their own dedicated infrastructure, such as ips, DNS, VPN connectivity,... while running most services in multitenant Kubernetes clusters. We will share how we built our solution making extensive use of Envoy to run networking tunnels between Kubernetes pods and customer dedicated infrastructure, enforcing encryption and mutual authentication using certificates. This allows, for example, different pods to have their own dedicated egress ip instead of the cluster's, or connections from pods to multiple customer on-premise services using VPN. The solution is provisioned automatically using Terraform, Terragrunt and other services.\n",

Now it is possible to produce a stream of updates from TiKV, which, with suitable deduplication, are ordered by their commit timestamps. In his talk, Zixiong Liu will talk about the techniques used in the design of TiKV that facilitate data streaming, and the implementation of the distributed computation performed on the exported TiKV data so that the data can be converted into formats suitable for consumption by third party data solutions.\n",

With more growth, communication becomes more critical.Design decisions and the way we communicate about them are affected by the assumptions we make about each other. If we aren't careful, problems can arise for everyone.

Salesforce embraced it by creating an open source framework for injecting sidecars. It did not take long for them to realize that webhooks should be written and deployed with great caution. This talk is about how Salesforce is using mutating admission webhooks for some of their most critical infra services in the Hyperforce architecture. They will cover the open source framework they developed and how it cuts down their cost of development and testing new webhooks. They will also talk about a new operator that allows them to rollout sidecars in a rolling update fashion. You will leave the talk, with a recipe for developing, maintaining and running highly available admission webhooks in production. Lastly, Salesforce will also talk about other alternatives of managing sidecars, challenges with managing and deploying them at scale and some potential solutions.\n",

Due to the nature of DoD systems, there are applications that are deployed in a more relaxed environment such as AWS GovCloud and also in a more restricted air-gapped environments with no internet or external connectivity. In the beginning, it was all about manual deployment and operations. By introducing Helm and Flux, DoD moved to a more declarative model where everything is version controlled and deployed by Flux thereby reducing manual operations, improving deployment consistency and also bringing more compliance with regard to change management and application life cycle. This session will walk through the migration steps, what it takes to operate Flux in an air-gapped environment and how we achieved parity when applications are deployed to environments with different constraints.\n",

But is it enough? Can you create a real isolated multi-tenant environment in it? With our experience with many production environments, we discovered it's not entirely. That is the reason why Capsule, an open-source Kubernetes Operator for multi-tenancy was born. Expanding the authentication Kubernetes capabilities, Capsule provides a viable and robust solution to avoid the hyped cluster sprawl while maintaining a native Kubernetes UX. And, last but not least, allowing a BYOD to push compute, storage, and network isolation and avoiding the noisy neighbors' effect. After a brief overview of the project by Dario Tranchitella (maintainer), Max Fedotov will explain how Capsule enhanced the operations and supercharged the provisioning mechanism for their k8s cluster at Wargaming.net\n",

This talk will review the pitfalls of those earlier application patterns with an assessment of why we've moved on and, most importantly, the benefits of now operating with an Envoy-based Service Mesh to help you manage your environment and enhance your development practices. It will also address how using a service mesh will help you migrate to this newer development style faster and safer to better enhance your organization's delivery times for updates to products and services.\n",

In this talk, we will introduce how Alibaba abstracts away infrastructure details and provides consistent experience across various deployment environments by leveraging Dapr and KubeVela. In Alibaba, many developers can now focus only on app code, and the microservice components and their environments will all be setup and managed by the platform with sidecar based approach.\n",

In this process, it also gradually exposed some deficiencies of the current system in architecture design, security and function, and faced more and more challenges. Therefore, it is necessary for us to launch the dragonfly 2.0 project and give it a clearer positioning: providing enterprise level (efficient, stable, secure, low-cost, product oriented) file distribution and management services, becoming the cloud native best practice and standard solution in this field. The new Dragonfly 2.0 will definitely bring a breakthrough in the field of file and image distribution.\n",

We work with the various container runtimes, kernels, networking, storage, and more; anything a pod touches is SIG Node’s responsibility! In this session, we will begin with an introductory overview of the SIG and what it has worked on in the past. We will then deep dive into ongoing efforts of the SIG, including features targeted for the 1.21 and 1.22 releases and future roadmap. Join this session to learn more about our SIG, and how you might get involved to make Node even better!\n",

You will learn the inherent security models provided by Kubernetes as well as additional configurations you can and should apply. Beyond concepts and architecture, a series of short demos will cover topics such as: - Security of Persistent Volume Claims and Persistent Volumes throughout their lifecycle - Pod Security Policies and volume types - File system permissions on your volumes - Securing common storage protocols such as iSCSI and NFS - Securing CSI drivers in your cluster\n",

We quickly realized our task was:  \"How do you provide and manage hundreds or even thousands of Kubernetes clusters that are distributed over hundreds of locations with only open source software and a 10 person dedicated SRE team?\" “Das Schiff” was born to run telco workloads including 5G Core, remote 5G UPFs, ORAN, MEC across all of these locations.Sailing in cloud native sea, we have found many wonderful communities from which to make our port of call. The marriage of ClusterAPI and FluxCD gave us the ability to drive automation through GitOps, but this time for infrastructure management at 5G scale. Bare metal Kubernetes is also core to our journey, with many small nodes for horizontal scalability to run cloud native network functions (CNFs). Deutsche Telekom has also found a home giving back to the community, through the CNF Working Group, helping make networking cloud native. Our ultimate aim is to bring our learnings and results into generalized and consumable formats for the community to build an open platform for 5G and cloud native telcos.\n",

      "description": "\n  Cloud-native has been taking the world by storm. However, I'm only a recent convert, having begun my tech career by selling against open-source software. As I began working with more complex organizations and applications, I started to see areas where OSS actually became a critical component to delivering an overall solution. Jeff Lawson, CEO of Twilio, has coined this as the \"digital supply chain\". And it makes sense, the advent of cloud-native development presented engineering teams with new challenges that many of their vendor-provided solutions just weren't prepared to overcome. Making matters worse, at many companies, management didn't have a grasp on the severity of this disconnect.This is where open-source came in to fill the gaps that were created. Open-source software consumption and participation was on a tremendous upswing even prior to the pandemic, with studies showing that 68% of companies planned to use more OSS than in the previous year. Additionally, Github found that at the start of the shelter-in-place lockdowns, individual users created 40% more open-source projects than in previous periods. In spite of these data points, you're still facing scrutiny and being asked to provide business justification when evaluating OSS as a possible solution for your technical challenges.This session will give you the inside scoop on how to position and align your OSS recommendation with business value so that all stakeholders hop on board. And for leaders, you'll see first-hand why OSS is preferrable in many instances, and a framework for how technology recommendations should be presented. As someone that has spent years convincing folks not to use OSS and then to definitely use it, I possess the real-world experience to show you what you're up against.\n",

Seconds after a node or a cluster are compromised, the bad actors start to take measures to make sure their hard work can profit for a while. What do they do? They start hiding their traces. Depending on the attack vector, they will need to hide their traces at multiple levels. They will begin by asking themselves some questions: - Are there are audit log mechanisms? - Kubernetes audit log is enabled? Can I tamper it? - There is deep packet inspection? Can I tamper it? - How to hide processes, containers, tasks to the owners? - There’s any non-conventional place where I can put files? - What about hiding my files in the kubernetes etcd? - How can I hide the network connections I make? In this talk we are going to discuss the broader picture of how the second part of an attack is handled by a bad actor.\n",

It utilizes a powerful open source component called BuildKit to build Dockerfiles into images directly inside your Kubernetes cluster. When you build images, they are immediately available on the cluster for testing without requiring pushing to an external registry, providing an extremely efficient inner loop for development. The builder supports the two most popular container runtimes–containerd and dockerd–and will auto-detect the correct runtime in most cases. kubectl build -t myimage:latest -f Dockerfile .\n",

It was a long and arduous journey, but we're very happy with the healthy community we have today, with maintainers from 5 different companies and a 5x increase in activity on the Cortex Slack and GitHub! While our _public_ adopters document lists more than 15 companies, with several providing Cortex as a service, we have a lot more companies running it, from international banks and Fortune 50 enterprises to small startups.

These devices are often too small to run Kubernetes, so how can they be dynamically leveraged by Kubernetes workloads? Akri is an extensible open-source Kubernetes-native project that aims to provide a solution. Akri provides an abstraction layer, removing the work of finding, utilizing, and monitoring the availability of IoT devices. We’ll dive into how Akri can discover IoT devices, advertise them as resources in your cluster, and then automatically deploy workloads to utilize those devices. Akri handles the dynamic appearance and disappearance of devices and automatically creates services, removing the need for an application to track the state of devices, pods, or nodes.

CNCF Ambassadors Kohei Ota and Kaslin Fields will use fun hand-drawn artwork to walk you through understanding what your cluster is really doing when you set a resource restriction in Kubernetes. Engineers and their applications are going through a transformation. From running apps on a machine or VM directly, to running it in containers, and then to container orchestration via Kubernetes. During this journey, it is easy to become disconnected from what’s really happening on the underlying infrastructure. By learning what Kubernetes is doing under the hood, you can get a deep understanding for how Kubernetes manages compute resources. This talk will cover what happens, starting from setting the restriction on a Kubernetes Pod, then how these parameters will be delivered from the Pod spec to the Linux kernel layer through kubelet and CRI/OCI runtimes.\n",

Without focus on specific services in particular, more of a push towards acceptance of managed services, especially if you're an engineer or leader that is considering Kubernetes but don't know how to get started. When discussing a managed Kubernetes service, responses have range from “why?” or “managed services aren’t as powerful” or the all too common reference to \"vendor lock in\" - often leaving those on the receiving end with a feeling of being lesser. Viewers will walk away from this session with more acceptance of managed services, and realize that using a managed service doesn't make one a bad engineer. There are many benefits to be had adoption of Kubernetes, and it's not a contest to prove how much you can build. If you have a small team and want to use Kubernetes, then a managed service can be the first step or only step towards Kubernetes usage.\n",

The need for microservice implementations on Windows is just as valid as it is on Linux.

What could go wrong? We demonstrate how subtle differences in the design of the experiment---how metrics are collected, queried, and used; the traffic shifting policy; the number of requests sent to different versions during the experiment and its duration; and when/how it is terminated---can lead to dramatically different outcomes, and in turn, directly impact the version of the app chosen to run in production. We also discuss simple and statistically effective remedies for the above problem, so that experiments become repeatable and their outcomes are more accurate and trustworthy.\n",

It will take more time and continued investment for them to generate a meaningful impact. . Some of these programs also struggle from a lack of experienced leadership, an inability to target the right audience, and unreasonable expectations.

EDL use Volcano as scheduler to deploy the Teacher model to an online Kubernetes GPU inference card cluster, and use the resources of the online inference GPU card to increase the throughput of the teacher model in knowledge distillation. At the same time, because the Teacher model can be flexibly scheduled by Volcano, there is no need to worry about task failures caused by preemption of online instances during peak hours. You can also deploy the Teacher model to cluster fragmented resources, or low-usage resources such as k40, to make full use of the cluster's idle and fragmented resources. In this lecture, we will explain in detail how to use Volcano to optimize elastic distillation training and give the corresponding benchmark data.\n",

Wonder no longer: CRI-O is a container runtime written exclusively for Kubernetes, and is ready to take the dockershim’s place. In addition to being a standard component for deploying secure and stable Kubernetes clusters, CRI-O has the unique advantage of being able to tailor its behavior to the needs of the Kubelet. In this talk, the maintainers of CRI-O will provide an update about the latest feature developments, as well as live demonstrating typical real world use cases around them. Join the CRI-O maintainers as they walk through the latest improvements in communication with the Kubelet under load, container stats reporting, user namespaces, and seccomp profile generation, as well as a general project update. After this session, you should know more about how CRI-O works in action and why it’s the perfect choice for your Kubernetes cluster!\n",

While there has been innovation in the development of minimal Linux distributions for running Kubernetes, the distributions diverge from each other in terms of management and API endpoints. Similar to other projects such as the Container Network Interface (CNI) , COSI has a focus on the configuration of the underlying operating system, providing Protocol Buffer definitions and a gRPC API reference implementation for configuration settings such as DNS, network, and kernel settings By utilizing a flexible plugin system, multiple backend implementations can provide a consistent API to consumers. In this talk we’ll review the configuration and APIs of popular container operating systems and Kubelet-node interactions. We will then review the COSI API, the plugin architecture, and demo node management using backend plugins written in Go and Rust.\n",

Simple mitigations and security best practices are no longer sufficient alone to protect production workloads. While tools like vulnerability scanning, signed container images, and distroless containers help, constant monitoring must take place in a running environment to ensure it remains safe from compromise. eBPF, an emerging Linux kernel technology, provides us unique visibility directly into any Kubernetes pod. Because pods on a node share a single kernel, a single eBPF program has full visibility to the entire node’s workloads. We’ll show how using such a program gives us the network and process-level visibility to detect and a live sophisticated attack on our cluster. We’ll finish by showcasing how security teams can easily put these same tools to use to protect their critical Kubernetes environments from threats.\n",

We want people in those countries to have access to Cloud Native technologies. Our mission is: building the foundation to inspire talent. During the last few months, we have created a virtual space offering resources which help enthusiasts to understand and contribute to open source projects. The pandemic brought many challenges to local preexisting communities but this wasn't our case, we have to opportunity to establish the community in a region where cloud computing technologies are barely known. This talk will share lessons that we learned in our journey to establish a local technical community remotely.\n",

Over the years the sidecar pattern has become more common in applications, gained popularity and the uses cases are getting more diverse. The current Kubernetes primitives handled that well, but they are starting to fall short for several use cases and force weird work-arounds in the applications. During this talk we will share how Netflix is using sidecar containers on Kubernetes, from their early design of process injection into docker containers, to a cutting edge fork of k8s where sidecar containers have special status and extra features over other containers in a pod. We would like to share our experience with sidecar containers and encourage others to do the same so we all benefit and learn. We will also share our efforts (past and ongoing) in collaboration with Kinvolk to progress a KEP to make sidecars a first-class concept in Kubernetes, and the status and implications of that process.\n",

The talk also presents the advantages of using k3s as a lightweight Kubernetes for POCs, the lessons learned at work when trying to implement MLOps using Scikit Learn for ML Models and Apache Spark for ETL processes. As a complement for k3s the talk describes how Argo can replace or complement pipelines designed with Apache Airflow and how these types of technologies prepare companies for Edge Computing.

Increasingly, however, organizations like Fastly, Shopify, and the team at Microsoft that built the new Flight Simulator all turned to it for use cases outside the browser, too.You may know that WASM is a W3C spec and that there’s a thriving open source community around it. But did you realize it’s already in the Kubernetes ecosystem? Envoy, a core component of several service mesh implementations, may be using it inside your cluster right now.In this talk, we introduce WebAssembly, the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI), and describe and show several projects that might help you take advantage of the same features these companies did: fine-grained sandboxing, polyglot portability, high application density, hardware agnosticism, and super fast reactivity.Each of these features adds a tool to your toolbox. We’ll also introduce you to the project ecosystem, and show you where to start learning, using, and contributing your cloud native experience to uplift everyone. Finally, we’ll share some of the exciting use cases running in production today and share how we think the Cloud Native ecosystem will evolve in the years to come -- and how you can imagine using it with the cloud native tools and processes you already know and love.All of this is open source software, upstream, built and maintained by the community.

We seem to have spent quite a bit of effort on those and now have a number of them from which to choose, such as LinkerD, Istio, Open Service Mesh, Kuma, Gloo Mesh, and Consul Connect, to name a few.But Layer 7 services are not all that are present in the universe and we need to look beyond the silo of L7 service meshes. Exploring the world of Layer 3 services, we introduced the Network Service Mesh (currently a CNCF Sandbox project) about 2 years ago.In this talk, we will introduce the generalized concept of I/O Meshes and define their attributes. As part of that journey, we will look at 3 concrete examples - the need for a Media Service Mesh for UDP-based services, a Data Mesh that connects together data objects and domains, and the concept of a Storage Mesh which connects together storage entities.\n",

For software to target these heterogeneous architectures, a standard ISA with a common core is required.

Thomas will also highlight exciting open source projects SUSE is contributing to including Epinio, Hypper, Kube-warden, Opni, FuseML, and Harvester. Maybe only a few will succeed and join CNCF, such as Longhorn and k3s, but all will contribute to advancing open source innovation.\n",

      "description": "\n  COVID-19 hit; country by country the world ground to a halt. We all became familiar with the headline stats, epidemiology became an interesting new profession. The R-number and contact tracing entered our lexicon as things we all knew about. Many countries had started on similar journeys to build systems that could use technology to identify people who are too close for too long where one has COVID-19. Openness and sharing defined the global approach to solving this problem. This presentation tells the story of how in 100 days an app was delivered; we also explore how Irish Government and the Irish Health service leverage CNCF projects in particular Kubernetes to respond to the crisis. The pandemic has also redefined how governments broadly are using OSS technologies to tackle major challenges. It’s a story of rapid decision-making, global collaboration, intense external scrutiny and hopefully redemption.\n",

Being the first security-focused project to graduate in the CNCF, TUF is widely used both inside and outside of the cloud ecosystem. It is in use today in places including CNAB, AWS Labs BottleRocket OS, and Datadog. With several ongoing integrations being actively developed including the Python Package Index (PyPI), Drupal, TYPO3 and Joomla. We will introduce TUF by describing the basic architecture, including how TUF protects against a variety of real-world attacks on any content distribution infrastructure.

      "description": "\n  Existing networking APIs like Ingress and Service were designed in the very early days of Kubernetes. They got many things right, but it was quite difficult or even impossible to use those APIs for more advanced use cases. This resulted in a proliferation of implementation-specific annotations and custom resources that fragmented the user experience and have proven to be difficult to evolve. The Kubernetes networking SIG has been developing a new set of APIs that aim to solve these problems. The Gateway APIs project defines Kubernetes APIs to configure advanced concepts like traffic splitting, header matching, and load balancing configuration. In this talk, Harry and Rob will provide an overview of these APIs and some insight into the design decisions that have been made along the way. They will demo some of the advanced capabilities of these APIs, showcasing the portability of the APIs across implementations. Finally, they will provide a roadmap for the future of this project.\n",

      "description": "\n  Cortex is a horizontally-scalable, highly-available and multi-tenant Prometheus-compatible time series database. For many years it has been possible to scale Cortex clusters to hundreds of replicas. The relatively simple Dynamo-style replication relies on quorum consistency for reads and writes. As such, a dual-replica failure can lead to an outage for all tenants. To address this we implemented a technique called “Shuffle Sharding” in Cortex. Shuffle Sharding lets you automatically pick a random “replica set” for each tenant, allowing you to isolate tenants and reduce the chance of an outage. In this talk we’ll show you how shuffle sharding achieves better scalability and more isolation, both in theory and in practice. We’ll walk you through the design on both the read and write path of Cortex. Finally we’ll do a live demo of shuffle sharding and how you can “take out” multiple replicas without affecting all tenants.\n",

      "description": "\n  In Logging, there is a common fact: more applications means more data to handle. Running services at scale in a distributed environment brings exciting challenges for data management, but with the volume of data increasing there is a necessity to ship this data faster, but a few ones realize the side effect: high resource consumption. On implementing a logging pipeline, pre-processing of the data is mandatory, a simple example of this is Kubernetes metadata enrichment for every log record, but more data means more computing time, the same cost applies when delivering to the final storage or cloud service. In this session, we will do a deep dive into our journey of performance challenges that we faced in the Fluent Bit project around Network I/O + TLS, filesystem buffers, routing, and multiplexing for high throughput. We will share how did we go from 5k/sec to more than 30k/sec using a single-core CPU using purely design improvements and taking the most of Linux OS interfaces.\n",

When deployed on multi-tenant clouds, they can span across nodes, regions, and multiple Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) while sharing CSP-owned resources between tenants. In such hostile environments, protecting containers data and code requires full trust on the CSP stack. Confidential computing leverages emerging hardware technologies to build Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) that protect cloud code and data at rest, in transit and in use, allowing tenants to trust no one but themselves. In this presentation, we will describe cloud native gaps for supporting confidential computing through memory encryption, authenticated launch and application attestability. Attendees will learn how secure container runtimes like Kata can close those gaps and leave with a proposed software architecture to bring confidential computing to cloud native workloads.\n",

With the increased prevalence of microservice-based distributed systems, it’s true - networking as a discipline has never been more critical in the efficient operation of cloud native deployments. Networking primitives, including load balancing, observability, authentication, authorization, policy, rate limiting, QoS, mesh networks, legacy infrastructure bridging, and so on are now receiving substantial development and investment throughout the industry and are the subject of focus of the CNCF Network SIG.\n",

In this talk, contributors will walk through their experience of learning to tell their own contributor story. In doing so, we will walk through how anyone can write a great story, including key takeaways around narrative, call to action (CTA), structure, and available channels. Along the way, we'll highlight tips to publish a blog, including collaboration with the Blog team, asking for reviewers from Upstream Marketing, and a brief look at relevant SEO practices. Attendees will leave with a formula by which they can share their story of contributing to Kubernetes and encourage others to share their unique and personal experience. Our goal is to inspire the next generation of open source contributors through a broad range of perspectives on what it means to contribute.\n",

When managing such broad and diverse clusters, variations in node capabilities and features are inevitable. So how exactly are individual features tracked on a node-by-node basis? Node Feature Discovery (NFD) is commonly used for basic feature discovery and labelling across a Kubernetes cluster. This talk, however, introduces a new component: Node Profile Discovery (NPD). NPD provides an extra layer of abstraction from NFD, alleviating the burden of managing individual features. NPD is designed to work in conjunction with NFD, aggregating individual features into higher level profiles and applying these profiles to suitable nodes. This talk will show how NPD can make life easier for application developers and sys-admins alike.\n",
