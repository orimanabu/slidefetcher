      "description": "\n  Why Attend NSMCon?Are you running workloads in multiple clusters? Across multiple clouds: on-premises, hybrid, multicloud, or public cloud? Do they need to interact with legacy workloads running in less “cloudy” environments? Network Service Mesh(NSM) ties them all together, at the granularity of individual workloads, not cluster/VPCs/data centers.NSM is a community-driven CNCF Sandbox project that is rapidly gaining momentum because of its ability to simplify connectivity between workloads, independent of where they are running. It extends an IP reachability domain to workloads running in multiple clusters, legacy environments, on-premises, or in a public cloud, communicating with the protocols they are currently using.NSM does this at the granularity of individual workloads. Your workloads have connectivity to just the workloads they need nothing more, nothing less. NSM brings the useful features of a Service Mesh from the lofty heights of HTTP all the way down to IP itself. Applications and Application Service Meshes, such as Istio, run unaltered on top, leaving the hybrid/multicloud IP connectivity to NSM.The project emerged organically as a community project to solve these problems by applying the Service Mesh thought process all the way down to IP with the global peering mentality of the Internet itself – without breaking your existing environment.Join the people building and using NSM at NSMCon for a day of tutorials, deep dives, and use cases to learn how NSM works, what it can do for you, and, most importantly, what’s coming next.How to register: Pre-registration is required.

      "description": "\n  Cloud Native Live: Evolving SecuritySecurity teams are challenged by cloud native - organizations are running more apps on more platforms in more places than ever before.  These apps are constantly changing while threats and compliance requirements continue to grow. At the same time, cloud native provides an opportunity to do security in a fundamentally better way - more automated and more integrated with development.  In this edition of Cloud Native Live, we bring together industry leaders, customers, and partners to talk about how they've made this promise real and how you can evolve your own security organization to not just enable cloud native but to capitalize on it.  Go deep not just on threats and countermeasures but also how to leverage cloud native technologies to improve the efficiency and capacity of your security team.At this Kubecon San Diego co-located event, we'll discuss this challenge, hitting on specifics like:How is cloud native security different than the cloud security you already know?How do you do more than just “shift left” and really integrate runtime security intelligence back with developers?How does a cloud-native, container-first approach change the traditional “firewall” model of security? How do you build security that spans all your modern compute options - from VMs to containers to serverless and everything in between? Interested in speaking?

At first, they were devoting all their time to managing on-call alerts and tech debt. Now, on-call alerts are manageable and infrequent, and the team is on a path to using entirely open sourced products.This stack was developed years prior, when there were few well-developed open source solutions available. Lauren describes how migrations to new tools (Grafana and Prometheus) decreased their backlog and on-call pages. She will also cover the improvements the team made to their own open source products (Heroic and FFWD) and why they chose to continue using and maintaining them. Lastly, she will discuss a new tool that the team will be repurposing and open sourcing in the near future.\n",

As any start to a relationship, things look fun and easy but once we talk performance at scale, compliance with internal security policies, and seamless onboarding, you might reconsider taking it home to meet your parents!With a highly distributed system that includes services running on Kubernetes clusters along with VM and Serverless workloads, vanilla service mesh would not work for us. In this talk, Hema \u0026 Cody will cover how Nordstrom’s relationship with service mesh evolved, what initial results revealed, what surprised us, and the open source contributions and adaptations we made to get to production readiness. We will share lessons learned and hopefully help with your service mesh relationship.\n",

An attacker with privilege access to k8S master node/host, can read the keys from memory, access secrets, compromising data \u0026 k8s cluster. This session proposes a solution (with a quick demo) to add a new KMS plug-in that leverages hardware based TEE (Trusted execution environment – like Intel SGX) to ensure that the keys, and the encryption of the secrets, are protected by the CPU on the master, addressing the threat vector mentioned.

      "description": "\n  Observability has gone from a thing you read about on Twitter or Medium thinkpieces to something your organization “has”. Maybe you’ve got a few new observability tools deployed. How is that working out for you?Regardless of your adoption level – from logs on local boxes up to the highest cardinality traces and feature analysis – at the end of the day these are tools, not magic spells. How do you teach, train, use, evangelize, and measure the impact they have in your organization?Cory has been a part of solo and large observability teams, in-house and vendor, and worked with dozens of companies. In this session he’ll explain some no-nonsense, tool agnostic methods for wringing more value out of what you have, identifying when to use new tools, how to handle migrations, how to measure value, and how to deal with “why does this cost so much?”\n",

We’ll look at how to incrementally bring Kubernetes into an existing application architecture based on existing VM or bare metal applications and services.Specific examples will demonstrate:- Using Contour with Envoy as an Ingress and load balancer solution with a richer feature set than some common alternatives- Sending requests from VM workloads to Kubernetes services- Direct requests to services running on a VM from Kubernetes- Dynamical traffic steering - K8s and VM workloads at the same time\n",

While lots of people in tech struggle with mental health, industry-specific research and advocacy in the community is disproportionately inadequate.For organizations, awareness and advocacy around employee mental health is crucial, after all, happy employees are more productive and less likely to leave their job. For employees who are struggling, it is important they know that they are not alone and there is help. This talk is focused on reducing the stigma around mental illness and expanding education and awareness into how to help yourself and others in your community.

In this talk, we'll discuss how KFServing powers some real-world examples of inference in production at Bloomberg, which supports the business domains of NLP, computer vision, and time-series analysis. KFServing (https://github.com/kubeflow/kfserving) provides a Kubernetes CRD for serving ML models on arbitrary frameworks. It aims to solve 80% of model serving use cases by providing performant, high abstraction interfaces for common ML frameworks. It provides a consistent and richly featured abstraction that supports bleeding-edge serving features like CPU/GPU auto-scaling, scale to and from 0, and canary rollouts. KFServing's charter includes a rich roadmap to fulfill a complete story for mission critical ML, including inference graphs, model explainability, outlier detection, and payload logging.\n",

This makes port mappings and usage from a developer’s point of view much much simpler. But from an infrastructure perspective, this makes the whole cluster use IP addresses liberally.On the Supply side, Kubernetes deployments generally run alongside incumbent networks. Therefore there are not enough IPs to allocate and have a production grade deployment.Based on real world experience by our customers so far, we have found that there are a few ways to design your clusters to address these concerns:-- Optimize the per node allocation so that the overall consumption can be optimized-- re-use IP addresses for Infrastructure but have unique Services IPs.-- Leverage a new IP addressing scheme through non-RFC 1918 ranges\n",

We will walkthrough how we orchestrate multiple components with Kubeflow Pipelines to extract data, label images, and (re)train machine learning models. We will also discuss best practices for authoring Kubeflow Pipeline components based on our experiences from developing and deploying these components for production use.\n",

In this session you will learn the basics about using Helm. We will look at the makeup of charts, the packages for Helm. From there we will explore the ways to share and consume charts. To complete the lifecycle, we will look at installing and managing charts in a Kubernetes cluster. Helm is a project that was first introduced in 2015 and was part of Kubernetes prior to the creation of the CNCF. It entered the CNCF as part of Kubernetes and grew to eventually became a sister project, alongside Kubernetes, in the CNCF.\n",

With plugins such as Route53, Azure, or Google Cloud DNS, CoreDNS exposes services from Kubernetes clusters and cloud service providers in similar fashion. In this Intro session, the focus is it to discuss service discovery in a hybrid environment. Several interesting Corefile configurations will be shared, which are very useful in production usage.

They argued for a Kubernetes reference distribution focused on correctness and stability.So where is it?After a slow start, we have momentum in 2019 to improve conformance, API stability, and better documented support stances.

      "description": "\n  In the span of two years, Spotify went from two developers investigating what a potential migration to Kubernetes might involve to having an internal, multi-tenant offering of Kubernetes become generally available for all its developers as the new, primary runtime offering.Spotify has previously given talks on the earlier bootstrapping, experimentation, alpha, and beta phases of this migration process. However, this talk will focus on the latter work involved in bringing the internal offering of Kubernetes “across the finish line.” The talk will cover what was required to bring the offering to general availability, including work shoring up scalability and reliability via a multicluster strategy, DIRT testing, operational metrics and alerts. This talk will also cover the technical and process elements involved in designing a successful self-service migration experience for developers.\n",

Pipeline building blocks can be reused, version controlled and curated in a catalogue that embeds best practices. Tekton, hosted by the CD Foundation, aspires to be the common denominator in CI/CD. The Tekton team wanted to make sure that the project is going in the right direction by \"dogfooding\" i.e. by using Tekton to run its own automation \"plumbing\". The initial continuous integration setup embedded most of the testing pipelines in bash scripts. The speakers replaced this with Tekton, hence improving the readability of the pipelines and the reproducibility of CI runs. Eventually, they moved onto continuously delivering Tekton and its pipelines via Tekton. In this talk, the speakers will tell their experiences about using a cloud-native pipeline system to test, release and continuously deploy itself.\n",

As companies adopt more of these workloads, tracking resource consumption and optimizing spending becomes more challenging.At Lyft, we developed a system which scrapes metrics from Kubernetes clusters and persists them in data warehouses. We then built a pipeline that transforms snapshots into cluster utilization metrics along the dimensions of CPU, memory, and GPU. Finally we join these metrics into our cost and usage dataset, so teams can budget resources accordingly and reduce spending.In this talk, we will give an overview of Infraspend - our infrastructure for tracking Kubernetes usage. Attendees will learn how the data we collected helped Lyft reduce spending for Kubeflow clusters.

      "description": "\n  Fifteen years of virtualized system software has led increasingly powerful capabilities, from containers to FaaS stacks, offering increasing levels of density and agility to application developers. These modern solutions, however, build on top of legacy layers that predate cloud computing as we now know it. Rethinking and reinventing these lower layers of the system stack can offer even greater improvements in density, performance, and security.One such example is at the VMM layer, which commonly depends on software that includes emulation and other unnecessary features. The rust-vmm project provides an alternative approach: a toolkit to build workload-specific virtual machine monitors. This keynote will discuss new developments in that project, from support of lightweight virtual machines to FaaS, and why you’d want to use different VMMs for these different delivery models.\n",

However, it will mainly focus on the migration of all HTTP ingress traffic, handled by a brittle, custom Nginx/HAProxy setup to an Envoy-based solution.The speakers will discuss how they’re migrating multiple high volume web services, serving millions of requests/sec, with minimum disruptions and zero-downtime for the feature teams that maintain Spotify’s backend services.This talk will also illustrate how Spotify’s engineering culture of loosely coupled but highly aligned teams has informed the decisions taken during the migration.\n",

We are told that these concepts will expand and help define the next generation of web services.That’s all well and good, but what is really going on inside these systems? What technology do those terms rely on and what does an Eventing workflow look like under the hood? Given the complexity and size of these projects’ codebases, it can be difficult to drill down and see what’s happening on a micro scale.Together, we will discuss, operate and modify a running distributed system built with CloudEvents and Knative Eventing.

Knative and Istio help with autoscaling, scale-to-zero, canary deployments to be implemented, and scenarios where traffic is optimized to the best performing models. This can be combined with KNative eventing, Istio observability stack, KFServing Transformer to handle pre/post-processing and payload logging which consequentially can enable drift and outlier detection to be deployed. We will demonstrate where currently KFServing is, and where it's heading towards.\n",

Moving to a distributed Service Mesh running on k8s to enable secure service-to-service communication was the solution. As Intuit was building a migration path for hundreds of services communicating across discrete networks, they faced a host of challenges. While developing a platform to provide end-to-end encryption, they defined a pattern for federated workload identities and learned to manage a federated set of mesh control planes.

Progressive delivery is the next step of CD, enabling service promotion for a subset of users in an automated fashion backed by metrics.There’s no one-size-fits-all on what are the appropriate metrics to drive promotions. Often, the four golden signals (latency, traffic, errors, saturation) are used, but what if this isn’t enough? More sophisticated techniques might use algorithmic or even AI-driven analysis.The Argo Experiment and Analysis CRDs provides simple constructs to drive automated promotion in an extensible fashion.This session discusses how Intuit leverages experimentation and analysis, the challenges in providing an automatic but generic approach to analyzing experiments, and envisioning the future of declarative progressive delivery.\n",

      "description": "\n  Microservices are the rage right now and for very good reasons. But microservices are not without drawbacks, requiring a complicated configuration and deployment, increasing the barrier to entry for both developers and users alike. This poor user experience can slow the rate of adoption for a project and hinder developers.There is a solution to this problem seeing a lot of success. A single binary app which can act as a monolith but can also be scaled as microservices. Thanos being a great example, where the kickstart is super simple yet can be scaled out as required. The Loki project was patterned after a similar model and we’ve since re-architected Cortex as well. In the talk we will explore how an application can be architected to be both a monolith and microservices, improving both adoption and ease of use while still allowing to scale as a cloud native microservices application.\n",

How to get anyone to actually use the framework once it’s in place?

Incorrectly implemented controls can result in catastrophic security failures.After we describe the trust zones, you’ll find the architectural issues are easy to identify. We’ll discuss a few! We’ll also situate vulnerabilities we found in our code review into each trust zone.Finally, we’ll teach you how to review your own Kubernetes environment using our threat model to get simple answers to your security questions.\n",

But what do you do when there’s a bug in the mesh itself?Paybase offers the most flexible, developer-native, API-driven solution for payments, compliance and risk. They use the Linkerd service mesh to process all requests that come through their complex system of microservices, where it is highly useful for out of the box gRPC load balancing which allows Paybase to scale their application.In this talk, Ana and Risha will talk about different Linkerd bugs that Paybase encountered after deploying Linkerd to their staging environment, and how they worked with the Linkerd maintainers to track them down and squash them.This talk also explores the relationship between companies that rely on open source software and their interactions with maintainers in the path to getting bugs fixed.\n",

It covers some of the \"hard parts\".The operator lives in the past: how to deal with resources cache inconsistencies? Why does idempotency matter? What can you do when StatefulSets are not good enough for the orchestration you need? How to empower advanced users but still provide good defaults? What namespace(s) should the operator have access to? How to test that monster you ended up building? These are questions engineers at Elastic had to answer.\n",

However, all of it is based on error rates, leaving latency concerns out of scope. Björn “Beorn” Rabenstein will explore various options of applying the same ideas to latency-based SLOs. The foundation is a precise and meaningful definition of the SLO. From there, Beorn will explore various techniques to translate the SLO into an error budget and how to measure its burn rate with Prometheus. Once that is done, creating error-budget-based alerts is relatively simple. There are, however, pitfalls and trade-offs along the way, which Beorn will help cope with.\n",

Linkerd is an ultralight service mesh for k8s. The projects share philosophy around simplicity, ease of use, speed, and low resource impact. OpenFaaS was designed for small teams and tackled multitenancy by creating OpenFaaS Cloud to layer on top. Scaling for multitenancy requires more robust networking, encryption, detailed metrics, and load-balancing strategies than Kubernetes L4 can offer.Linkerd fits because it provides the features listed above required for scaling multitenancy while remaining focused on simplicity, security, and performance as a part of a modular platform built around OpenFaaS.\n",

Kopf provides powerful, high-level abstractions that make it simple to write Kubernetes operators in Python, allowing you to focus on your application logic without needing to dive headfirst into Kubernetes internals. In this talk, you will learn how to make your own Kubernetes operators in a few lines of Python code, and how to bring your own domain entities directly to Kubernetes.\n",

We present a simulation toolkit, which can simulate large-scale K8S clusters and scheduling using a single machine plus a small number of containers. The simulator runs a real K8S master and schedules pods according to event traces generated from real K8S clusters. It provides a complete set of metrics, including resource utilization, detailed scheduling trace and performance metrics, enabling developers to evaluate the scheduling behavior and performance with a reasonable amount of confidence. We have used the toolkit extensively to optimize the scheduler for large scale K8S clusters (~10K nodes) at JD.com.\n",

      "description": "\n  When you think of container orchestration mainframes probably aren't the first thing that come to mind.But modern mainframes run Linux as a first class citizen and KVM can be used for virtualization, opening a whole world of open source tooling integration via libvirt and related virtualization tooling. The careful observer may have already discovered that the mainframe architecture (s390x) is one of the architectures that's built for every Kubernetes release.How did this come to be? Who uses these mainframe builds of Kubernetes? Why would you run a distributed container orchestration service on a platform that's a symbol of the monolith we're looking to leave? Drawing upon my work with distributed systems and containers, including time spent on OpenStack, Apache Mesos and Kubernetes, and my new experience with mainframes, this talk answers all of those questions and more.\n",

Have you ever seen an application be throttled even though it’s no where near its CPU limit?Up till now, the answer has always been simply turn off hard-limits, but that has potentially nasty performance implications in shared environments. Now there's another option! This session will explain the real root cause of what has been happening. We'll introduce the kernel mechanisms that Kubernetes and other Container Orchestrators rely on to enforce CPU limits. We'll then show how they were broken, how we fixed them, and what those changes mean for you and your clouds.By the end of this session you'll understand exactly what you are getting when you set the CPU limits on your pods.\n",

However, since Notary’s design around Docker Hub in 2015, container registries have proliferated and some of the design decisions don’t support the needs of a multi-registry world. This talk looks at redesigning the model to allow portability of container images between registries with signature data stored alongside the image data allowing it to be pushed and pulled alongside the image. This reworking of Notary will enable easier portability of images, and improve supply chain security by enabling mirrors and users of mirrors to validate image data, allowing users to easily work with cloud and local registries, offline caches and other common architectures.\n",

We will deep dive into how you can scale your applications across virtual kubelet. One issue is the kubernetes service type has is scaling to zero due to the way routing to the pod happens if there is no pod for the service to route too. Scaling our applications to zero is just as important and scaling up. We will look at projects that integrate with the horizontal pod autoscaler that fix this issue.

      "description": "\n  Darek Gajewski, Principal Infrastructure Analyst for Ancestry.com, relies on Kubernetes to quickly integrate and deploy applications across Ancestry’s website, which receives 50-million visitors a month, and generates more than a billion dollars in revenue.To get optimum performance out of Ancestry’s cloud applications, Ancestry employed artificial intelligence for continuous optimization of the application runtime environment. AI brings continuous optimization (CO) to the CI/CD process. In a PoC, Ancestry used AI to cut the resources of one application by more than 50 percent, with zero drop in performance. In this instance, Ancestry has been able to get two times the performance out of Kubernetes for every dollar spent.AI-powered CO delivers a well-optimized infrastructure personalized to the workload and delivers better reliability, at higher performance, for much lower costs.\n",

With Ignite, users can:*Launch and manage entire “app ready” stacks from Git*Run legacy or special apps in lightweight VMs (eg for multi-tenancy)*Run a cloud of VMs ‘anywhere’ using Kubernetes for orchestration, Ignite for virtualization, GitOps for management, and supporting cloud native tools and APIs.Ignite contributor Mark Emeis will share why Kubernetes SIG Lead and Weaveworks DX Engineer, Lucas Käldström, created Ignite, how it works, and how to get started.\n",

By proactively testing how a system responds under stress, you can identify and fix failures before they end up in the news. Chaos Engineering lets you compare what you think will happen to what actually happens in your systems. You literally break things on purpose to learn how to build more reliable systems.Lenny Sharpe walks you through Chaos Engineering at Target, covering the tools and practices you need to implement Chaos Engineering with Kubernetes in your organization. Even if you’re already using Chaos Engineering, you’ll learn to identify new ways to use the practice to improve the reliability of your network and services. Ana Medina will share a demonstration of how you can practice Chaos Engineering on Kubernetes and use it to improve the reliability of your systems. She gets you started using Chaos Engineering with your own team and gives you the tools to measure success. She will also demonstrate how GameDay environments can be used to learn about Chaos Engineering. She explains how to practice Chaos Engineering on AWS EKS, GCP GKE, Azure AKS and your own homegrown Kubernetes environments.Some advanced topics you’ll cover include how to use monitoring tools combined with Chaos Engineering to help you create reliable distributed systems, where you can learn more, and how to join the Chaos Engineering community.\n",

What's hard is making sure it's working, and making sure that it keeps working as changes are made.  Over the life of Ambassador we've gone through multiple cycles of adding tests to increase confidence, from simple unit tests to larger integration suites, such as our Kubernetes Acceptance Test (KAT) framework. Several times these tests have become too slow, and then we had to work to speed them up so our velocity doesn't suffer.   Join Flynn to learn what we would do again in regard to our dev/test loop if we chose to build another open source tool, and also (more critically), what we would change.\n",

Operators can be used to provision multiple applications in a consistent manner while adhering to best practices for that particular installation.To discuss the future of the operator pattern and why are operators have become so valuable to organizations working with containers, we've assembled some key project leads, engineers, and builders of operators to help demystify the concepts, share lessons learned and best practices for building operators and grow the operator community.\n",

      "description": "\n  Baidu internally has improved the performance of large-scale deep learning workloads by using the Volcano project. The CRD-based computing resource model makes it possible to use resources more efficiently and configure computing models more flexibly. The Volcano project has unified abstraction of the underlying capabilities of group scheduling, fair share, priority queue, job suspend/resume, etc., which makes up for the lack of functionality of the native job based training operator.After using Volcano, Baidu's internal resource utilization increased by 15%, and the training task completion speed increased by 10%. This talk will introduce the overall function of Volcano, transformation of the old operator to support Volcano, and the comparison of the performance of deep learning training tasks before and after using Volcano.\n",

In this deep dive session, we will start a journey from questions like “What is the Application?” to “The layers and phases through application delivery”, then all the way to the typical model and pattern of application delivery. We will use certain open source projects as concrete examples to explain how they fit into this model, their maturity level in each layer, what’s missing, and the direction the application delivery SIG  is trying to pursue. The session will help audiences figure out not only “what project X is doing”, but also “in what layer project X is working” and “how it performs there.”\n",

Metrics can give you a high level view of application’s responses and performance and tracing can give you a detailed view of requests through applications. Often when using metrics in graphs or alerts you want be able to jump to an example of a request represented by a given metric datapoint which is difficult to do today. In this talk we show an example of this using an OpenTelemetry exporter to publish trace IDs as exemplars using the OpenMetrics exposition format.We then walk through configuring Jaeger as a tracing backend and M3 as a metrics backend to store the trace ID alongside a datapoint. We show how it is then possible to go from a metrics graph that visualizes the latency of your application to a trace that fell into a latency bucket using the deep link of the trace ID.\n",

      "description": "\n  A typical container image builder takes a base OS from somewhere, runs scripts to add and modify all the things needed for an app to run, then deploys to a registry. This leads to large images which developers try to trim down by using multistage builds, removing files and squashing filesystem layers. Building container images in this way makes it difficult if not impossible to ascertain the license and security implications of using these images.How do we generate app specific build and runtime images without having to maintain our own base OS images and build machinery?Fortunately, this is a problem that has been solved in the Linux distribution world for some time. This talk will outline some popular tools and compare them against the requirements for a declarative and reproducible container OS builder which is not reliant on any external infrastructure.\n",

The technical details about how k3s is packaged as a single binary, how sqlite was added as a data source, how certs are managed, how HA is achieved, how agent tunneling works and much more. Finally, Darren will discuss how these changes are made while still being a fully certified CNCF Kubernetes distribution.\n",

      "description": "\n  Training a Neural Network may take days or weeks, even on a top of the line GPU. To reduce training time, distributed computation is often employed to spread the work across multiple GPUs and multiple nodes. Horovod is the best example of such a scalable architecture. At NVIDIA, in collaboration with the community, we have configured Kubernetes and multi-node infrastructure to deliver performance that scales as we add more GPUs and nodes. This talk presents the problems and solutions related to networking discovered during this journey.The inexhaustive list includes solutions like CNI for multiple networks using SRIOV, enabling RDMA over IB and Ethernet (RoCE) to provide low latency, high throughput and direct GPU to NIC connectivity (GPUDirect), enforcing PCI affinity of GPUs with respect to Network Interfaces, using Source-Based routing within pods for L3 networks and much more.\n",

The Linux networking stack simply cannot keep up with increasing demands for higher throughput and lower latency of these packet flows. The packet processing pipeline is now run in userspace instead, bypassing the kernel. DPDK provides an environment and API to run high-intensive packet processing in userspace. Many CNFs are developed using DPDK. A DPDK application requires specific resources from a host for guaranteed performance. Deploying and running such applications in K8s is always a challenging task.In this presentation \u0026 demo, users will learn about open source technologies and components and how to leverage them to deploy workloads that requires high performance networking infrastructure in a Kubernetes cluster.\n",

Under the covers, it relies on SPIFFE to provide the cryptographic identity that is used to perform this mutual authentication.SPIFFE relies on an authority to issue identity. In an Istio mesh, Istio Citadel (CA) issues certificates to workloads by default... but, what happens when you have more than one Istio mesh, and hence more than one Citadel? Or Istio workloads talking to external services?Enter SPIFFE federation. It allows SPIFFE identity issuers to peer with each other, enabling workloads in disparate domains to securely authenticate and communicate with each other.

Typical workloads include parameter sweeps, Monte Carlo simulations and partitionable dataset processing. Kubernetes by itself is not very well suited for such workloads, which are submitted by hundreds of concurrent users and rely on the execution of thousands, or even millions of small tasks. This presentation will provide an overview of how HTCondor, a prominent HTC system, can be used to effectively and efficiently manage such workloads. The author has been running such a system on a Kubernetes cluster operated out of the University of California San Diego, and will share his experience and issues he encountered during that time.\n",

Is the tradeoff between better operational tools and introducing a new dependency layer on the path to production for application teams worthwhile? Are we making life easier for application teams or instead reducing their end-to-end ownership?Manuel will then introduce Team Topologies, a balanced approach for thinking about teams responsibilities and interactions which can help get the most value out of your Kubernetes adoption.\n",

When scaling became critical, we often suffered through several minutes of waiting for new EC2 instances to come online. The idea of containers scheduling and serving traffic within seconds as opposed to minutes was appealing to us.During our migration in early 2019, we reached critical mass within our Kubernetes cluster and began encountering various challenges due to traffic volume, cluster size, and DNS.

OPA Gatekeeper integrates with Kubernetes and is able to provide the right guardrails to enforce structure and keep your deployments running smoothly. In this session we'll talk about policy management and how OPA Gatekeeper can help manage policies at scale. We'll walkthrough the high-level architecture of Gatekeeper along with applied examples and demonstrate how it can be used to manage security and traffic management mechanisms found in service mesh deployments.\n",

Optimizing startup time is critical to support use cases such as autoscaling, upgrades, and failure recovery. The recent rise of the serverless model, along with its key value proposition of scale-to-zero of idle workloads, has made pod startup time important than ever: The platform must be able to start the pod fairly quick, such that the latency of request-triggered scale-from-zero is acceptable.In this talk, we'll analyze the latency contributed by Istio service mesh to pod startup time, right from pod creation and up to the pod becoming ready to service requests. We'll also examine various techniques to reduce it, including using Istio CNI to bootstrap the pod's network, launching the sidecar proxy with an initial routing configuration, and using manual sidecar injection.\n",

      "description": "\n  Pinterest is a cloud first visual discovery engine that serves over 250MM users. To support this scale, there are thousands of services running on tens of thousands of hosts, processing 300+PB of data. We operate large kubernetes clusters across several availability zones, across regions. The cluster is auto scaled with support for pod level auto-scaling. Finally,to effectively utilize resources within the clusters, we operate heterogeneous workloads on a kitchen sink of instance types. Given this,1.Who owns what?2.What is driving utilization?3.How do we plan capacity effectively with minimal overhead?In this talk, we will share how we built a governance platform to address the above through defining canonical ownership, metering resource utilization (at various granularities) + reporting and finally a policy enforcement mechanism (ex, pre-emption, placement, etc).\n",

      "description": "\n  Kubernetes provides a number of primitives to manage resource consumption. Implementing resource limits, requests and quotas are often the first steps taken to solve this problem at the pod or namespace level. However, the behaviour of an overall Kubernetes cluster as it nears capacity and the parameters available to tune it are often overlooked. To ensure optimal stability and utilization of a cluster, users must learn how to implement, test and manage these parameters over time.With their field engineering work done for healthcare and financial customers, Randy and Koushik have gathered valuable lessons on how one should approach this problem.This talk will illustrate how you should approach resource limits, resource requests, eviction policies and node allocatable constraints to get the most out of your Kubernetes clusters.\n",

      "description": "\n  Managing state on multiple shared Kubernetes clusters may sound scary. The Goldman Sachs Kubernetes team uses OPA to manage that state using two different applications of policy. The first is the validating admission control policies that prevent unsafe resources on the cluster. The second, and novel, application goes beyond simple yes/no decisions and uses OPA policy to provision new resources on the cluster to implement a common baseline, e.g. RBAC, Volumes, ResourceQuotas, and LimitRanges.This talk focuses on the architectural design that allows GS to run OPA at scale in production. Along the way we discuss best practices and lessons learned, highlighting how GS reduced policy deployment times from days to under 10 minutes. The audience will learn how to create their own policy pipelines using popular open-source tools to enforce OPA policy across multiple Kubernetes clusters.\n",

They will explore practical techniques for triaging issues in a service mesh, along with the intuition behind them. The presenters will cover a broad range of topics including traffic capture, issues specific to GRPC, health checks, and techniques useful during incident mitigation. The talk will end with a deep dive into Envoy stats and their use in resolving issues.\n",
