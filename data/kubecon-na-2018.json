      "description": "\n  From beginner to experts.... Join this free workshop covering the basics and how to implement HPE hybrid cloud and container solutions.  The workshop led by HPE technical experts will provide a technical information on:1. End to End Hybrid Cloud Management using HPE OneSphere - Digital disruption is having a profound effect on every company. IT departments are being asked to support an increasing number of providers and manage a faster application cadence. HPE OneSphere helps by providing a managed cloud layer on existing virtualized infrastructure and being a single portal to manage a hybrid cloud and container environment. You’ll learn how HPE OneSphere, with its powerful REST API, can compose hybrid clouds capable of supporting both traditional and cloud-native applications.Speaker(s) – Steve Showalter, Said Syed, Paul Holland, Travis Tripp2. Storage for Containers  – Introduction to the HPE Storage portfolio in relation to containers and Kubernetes in particular. HPE 3PAR, HPE Nimble Storage and HPE Cloud Volumes all provide advanced data services to drive popular use cases for container deployments. In this session you’ll learn the basics of persistent storage in Kubernetes and the components needed to allow dynamic provisioning. Also, don’t miss this opportunity to learn what HPE Storage has in store for CSI (Container Storage Interface) the next generation storage interface for container orchestrators.Workshop pre-requisites: Please bring a laptop with root access to a Ubuntu 18.04 instance if you’re interested in following along as we deploy Kubernetes, persistent storage drivers and setup dynamic provisioning. We’ll then walk through a few examples how to deploy a stateful workload on Kubernetes.Speakers: Michael Mattsson, Eric Forgette3. Containers with End to End Life Cycle using HPE Composable Infrastructure - Provides the flexible infrastructure you need to incorporate container services into DevOps, host existing applications, add new micro services, and modernize legacy applications. It enables you to dynamically provision and scale applications, whether they run in VMs or containers. The software defined architecture allows you to compose compute, storage, and networking resources to target specific workloads. HPE Image Streamer enables stateless deployment of the operating system and other supporting software required to make the resources ready to run.Speaker(s) – Bob Fraser4. HPE Proliant for Azure Stack - This hybrid cloud solution enables you to deliver Azure services from your data center. Azure stack allows you to bring modern cloud services to your sensitive data and edge applications that may not yet be suitable for the public cloud.Speaker(s) – Vivek KulkarniIn these workshops during the day, we will walk through the challenges of deploying and managing applications in hybrid cloud environments. The workshops will include hands on demonstrations in a class room setting with subject matter experts to help you out.Schedule:8:30 AM – 9.00 AM Check-in and breakfast9.00 AM – 9.15 AM Introduction (Said)9:15 AM to 10:45 AM OneSphere (Steve Showalter, OneSphere Evangelist)10:45 AM to 11:00 AM Break11:00 AM to 12:30 PM Cloud and Container Storage12:30 PM to 1:15 PM Lunch1:15 PM to 2:45 PM Container BMaaS on HPE Composable Infrastructure2:45 PM to 3:00 PM Break3:00 PM to 4:30 PM Private Cloud HPE Azure Stack4:30 PM to 5:00 PM Wrap up, Raffle and Networking!SOLD OUT\n",

Advanced Challenges We Solved ForAutomation – Cluster Deployment AutomationInstaller(KOPS / KubeAdm) tradeoff, and our experience with building our ownLogging – Solving for inconsistent log aggregationFinding an extensible solution to balance between disparate existing legacy logging solutions and a scalable architecture without operational overheadSecurity – Achieving CIS benchmark complianceSolving for cloud native security posture for legacy monolithic applicationsOperator Framework / Persistent Volumes / Session AffinityWhere we leveraged and how we solved for itEmbracing Google SREWhat worked for us and what is difficult to achieve3. Metrics, Workload Migration, Training \u0026 Developer EnvironmentMeasuring BenefitsDefining what to measure is comparatively easy, but how do you consistently measure across hundreds of workloads and how can a platform like Kubernetes contribute to achieving the measurement?Workload Migration – planning and approach for large scale migrationWhat type of legacy workloads (including stateful) were we able to migrateTrainingTechnology training is helpful, but enterprise environment and training labs are not the same. How do you bridge the gap, we will share our approach / playbookDeveloper EnvironmentLeveraging Docker for Developer environment setup and eliminating frictions in cross team developer migration and application setup4.

It is simply an orders of magnitude larger problem to network and debug a set of intertwined distributed services versus a single monolithic application.Originally built at Lyft and now a CNCF incubating project, Envoy is a high performance C++ distributed proxy designed for single services and applications, as well as a communication bus and “universal data plane” designed for large microservice “service mesh” architectures. Envoy runs alongside every application and abstracts the network by providing common features in a platform-agnostic manner. When all service traffic in an infrastructure flows via an Envoy data plane, it becomes easy to monitor problem areas via consistent observability, tune overall performance, and add substrate features in a single place.SOLD OUTLearn more\n",

This process is often long and tedious and can last for over a year.  Open Control is a new standard by 18F, an agency bringing lean start-up methods to the U.S. Government, in order to address ATO repeatability. Red Hat has worked with 18F to help create a Kuberenetes implementation based on Open Control to automate much of the ATO process for Kubernetes systems.\n",

Datadog applications are network-intensive, so we invested a lot of time in optimizing the network when we started to migrate to Kubernetes to minimize the induced overhead. This talk will start by giving a quick overview of our challenges. It will then explain how we manage the different types of traffic: pod-to-pod, pod-to-service and ingress. For all of those, I will show how our setup evolved and why and what we are looking into for the future. The talk will detail the CNI and ingress plugins we explored and the issues we faced along the way, as well as some contributions we made to these projects.\n",

To improve the observability and quality of service, we realize a need to connect these failure points across the distributed topology to reduce mean time to know and resolve.   I will present a quick journey of distributed tracing that started with Zipkin and ended in building our own solution in open source. We designed the system using Kafka (KStreams), Cassandra, ElasticSearch and MetricTank with the key focus on extensibility and OpenTracing principles.

One challenge with DNS-based service discovery though is the unreliable nature of the UDP protocol used by DNS. There is no guarantee of the delivery for the query and response of service records.  In this discussion, we provide a mechanism of CoreDNS over gRPC to address the reliability issue of DNS-based service discovery. As a flexible DNS server, CoreDNS is capable of transport over multiple protocols besides traditional UDP. With DNS over gRPC for inter-node communication and normal UDP for local-node DNS serving, we are able to achieve the much-needed reliability while maintaining the easy-to-use DNS front end for service discovery in Kubernetes clusters.\n",

Well, not quite: there are still some important unknowns to understand before your service will be ready for production. It's still unclear how the new service behaves when it's being pushed, and it's possible that K8s will kill the service before serving a single request. At Buffer, we've developed a technique to optimize K8s deployment limits using load testing to identify optimal resource limits. When the service is under heavy load there are a few key metrics to watch to identify bottlenecks. These key metrics can be used to adjust resource limits. This approach allowed us to safely and efficiently switch over more than half our production traffic to our K8s cluster and can be applied to any application.  This talk will include a live demo of how to tune Etcd using methods we do at Buffer.\n",

Beyond the core of container orchestration, there are abstractions for load balancers, persistent storage and autoscaling, to name a few. With this in mind, when Manifold set out to switch cloud providers, we decided to do so by first using as many abstractions in the Kubernetes ecosystem as possible.  In this talk, we will explore how Manifold used Kubernetes to migrate between cloud providers. We will look at how to identify cloud specific services and APIs in use in your application, and how Manifold evaluated whether to uplift to a Kubernetes abstraction, translate to the other cloud provider’s service, or keep as is. Finally, we will discuss the challenges and successes of the actual migration between cloud providers.\n",

These methods are more fail safes than applying software delivery best practices, i.e., start from a well defined Bill of Materials (BoM).  Can we build a container from a well defined software component manifest? What would that manifest look like?

Data processing is one of the common of applications that benefit from the power of Kubernetes. However attempting real-time computer vision processing on Kubernetes isn't that straightforward, as the maximum processing time for a single frame is expected to be less than 30ms to reach 30fps or no more than 60ms (15fps, start being laggy). This presentation demonstrates the actual issues, feature gaps encountered and workarounds applied running a real-time vision pipeline on Kubernetes from the presenter's hobby robotics project. The pipeline involves a few image pre-processing tasks, a ML model (SSD mobilenet) for object detection and depth estimation with a single camera. The biggest challenge is how to distribute the tasks across nodes with data locality in consideration.\n",

This talk will demonstrate the various methods we’ve used to link the data together. Prometheus is providing the metrics. Via its histograms, request latencies can be extracted to inform each tracing span from Jaeger. Grafana also ensures that lines from your log aggregation system are annotated with span and trace IDs, as well as the other way around: associating logged values with spans.

A team was assembled to investigate the vulnerability, develop a patch, and release it to all supported versions of Kubernetes -- ALL in secret.  As we walk through the story from discovery to disclosure, we will also deep dive into the technical details of how this feature allowed a container to escape to the host filesystem, and how it was fixed.  You will walk away with techniques for secure file handling in multi-tenant environments, best practices for restricting volume access in your Kubernetes clusters, and an understanding of how a large open source project manages security issues.\n",

Thank you for your understanding.In the adoption of cloud native technologies engineers find one of the greatest challenges is the management of services in distributed systems. Service management challenges include service discovery, load balancing, fault tolerance, end-to-end monitoring, dynamic routing for canary deployments and securing communication. Istio solves these problems by providing a layer of infrastructure between the services and network that allows service communication to be controlled outside the application code.During this workshop you will gain hands-on experience as we walk through deploying Istio alongside microservices running in Kubernetes. In a series of hands-on labs, we see:• Traffic Management, Resilient Communication and Load Balancing• Policy Enforcement and Rate Limiting• Telemetry, Monitoring and Reporting• Securing Communication• Canary Deployments\n",

In addition, as a small team managing clusters in several isolated datacenters around the world, achieving commonality is challenging.  While we started using container orchestration because we wanted to increase resource utilisation and deployment agility, we have found the real value has been in our ability to abstract many of the differences between clusters.  Now, as we move towards Kubernetes, we will share lessons for shifting developers between different container orchestrators as seamlessly as possible by using Spinnaker as a common continuous deployment tool.\n",

Building a cloud-native virtualization API which supportsexisting and new virtualized workloads, but at the same time also fits seamlessly into Kubernetes, turns out to work out quite fine most of the time. However, there are also areas where virtualizationrequirements are crossing the boundaries of Kubernetes existing features or cloud-native concepts. On the other hand crossing the boundaries, is an opportunity to work with the Kubernetes community to enable additional use-cases for both containers and virtual machines.In this BoF we’ll be taking a look at existing features but also at features which are currently driven by the community, and also features which are currently blocked.\n",

Audit logs can tell us what happened in our clusters, when it happened, who did it, what resources were affected, and more. The problem is, even a fairly stagnant Kubernetes cluster generates millions of audit logs per week. And it's up to us to distill value out of what is largely just noise.   So, how can we isolate important audit events to better understand what's going on in our clusters?  In this session, we'll first go over what Kubernetes audit logs are and what information they provide. We'll then do a live a demo of getting audit set up on a cluster, and inspect the raw logs that are generated. And finally, we'll talk about strategies for pulling useful information out of the deluge, so we can make sense of these millions of audit logs glean actionable insights.\n",

But you can't simulate an entire networking topology with Kubernetes. Or can you?  The declarative approach of Kubernetes makes it simple to recreate and orchestrate distributed applications for continuous integration. In this session we are going to talk about how we used L2 device plugins to wire up the different parts of our applications. And how KubeVirt allowed us to even test pre-existing virtual network appliances in the very same setup.  This setup enables entire enterprise topologies to be modeled and validated before released into production.\n",

The project has 8 repositories on GIT and has hundreds of contributors actively working on its repos on daily basis, which makes productivity super critical so that every contributor’s time is well spent and quality of code is ensured. This talk gives an overview of how contributor productivity is achieved for Knative from 4 dimensions: test health, release health, metrics, and performance. We will go over test infrastructures in place to show how it makes writing and running tests is an easy and pleasant experience for contributors. We will explain how release is done in automated and predictable fashion, and what thoughts have gone into release design so that it also benefits other Knative personas. We will go over a set of metrics defined for Knative project health, show how we measure and track metrics at ongoing basis to drive up project health overall. We will also look at performance and explain what type of infrastructure has been built to support perf/scale/load testing.\n",

Kubernetes has gained lots of momentum in recent years but lacks the scale and efficiency needed by web-scale companies.  This talk introduces Peloton - A unified scheduler for mixed workloads that is horizontally scalable to 10K+ nodes and millions of containers. It has an extensible architecture and supports both Mesos and Kubernetes. Peloton manages compute resources more efficiently and guarantees hierarchical max-min fairness for different teams. It provides a seamless path for companies on Mesos to adopt Kubernetes. Peloton is also cloud agnostic and can be run on-prem or in any public Cloud.\n",

I will share how we automate all routine operations, providing developers with easy-to-use tools to create, manage and monitor their database, avoiding commercial solutions lock-in and saving costs. I will describe the benefits and pitfalls of running production databases on Kubernetes and, finally, show open-source tools we have built for application developers to deploy and manage PostgreSQL clusters by writing short manifests describing a few essential properties of the result.\n",

At the same time, the concept of microservices through containerization has increased in popularity as it allows for developers to create and package applications for easy export and distribution through various clouds.Kubeflow is an open source project lead by Google to merge both concepts, allowing users to leverage the power of Kubernetes to run the training and serving of their ML models.This convergence of technologies does result in a new way to think of Machine Learning. We now think of can think of machine learning as code bundles. My session will show how with Kubeflow and GitOps tools, you can go beyond simply deploying and training TensorFlow models but bundling the entire infrastructure into a code package and treat the entire machine learning process as a pipeline.\n",

The Cloud Native community spans the globe but getting to know the community near YOU can be especially helpful. Meetups are a common tool throughout the tech world for people with similar interests to meet and learn from one another, and it’s particularly popular with open source communities. Whether you’re in Austin, Texas, Seattle, WA, or lots of other places around the world, there’s probably a meetup (or several!) near you. And if there isn’t, you can start one yourself! In this talk, container and cloud-native related meetup founders, organizers, speakers, and hosts from companies ranging from small startups to large fortune 500 companies will discuss their experiences with the meetup community.\n",

      "description": "\n  Companies that create products for other companies or teams often have to reason about how to deal with the application-level tenancy of each team. The two ends of the spectrum are to either deploy one monolithic application that handles multi-tenant data isolation via application logic or to deploy and proxy to many instances of isolated single-tenant applications.  This presentation will discuss how Kolide has approached the problem of application tenancy by building a Kubernetes Operator to manage the complete lifecycle of each tenant as an isolated instance of a single-tenant application. We will analyze strategies for account management, observability, deployments, networking, and security.  Finally, we will consider the efficacy of this strategy in general by analyzing the observed pros and cons after using this approach in production to serve thousands of customer instances.\n",

NATS is a cloud-native messaging project that addresses these needs and others. In this discussion, we'll introduce you to NATS: how NATS came to be, its DNA and cover some of the problems that it solves. We’ll describe common messaging patterns, when to use them, and design principles to create NATS enabled cloud-native applications.

The conventional wisdom claims that Metrics, Logging and Tracing are “the three pillars” of observability… yet software organizations check these three boxes and are still grasping at straws during emergencies.  In this session we’ll illustrate the problem with the three pillars: metrics, logs, and traces are just data – they are the fuel, not the car. We then reframe observability around two fundamental activities: (1) measurement and (2) explanation.  “Measurement” must be both robust and precise; “explanation” must present the larger context of distributed transactions and the role that contention plays under peak load. We present both via demos and examples to ground the session in real-world storytelling.\n",

And should you have to choose?  In this keynote, Jason McGee will share his vision for the marriage of containers, apps, and functions -- driven by Kubernetes, Istio and the emergence of Knative into a single combined container platform.  It’s time to break down the silos and see how these projects’ paths are converging to solve real microservice dilemmas: security, scale, and operations.\n",

We discuss testing against trace data rather than code, and how this technique opens the door to an entire suite of verification practices which are difficult to achieve with the current unit/integration test dichotomy.   We show that Trace Tests can span across multiple network calls, languages, and services, while still retaining unit-test-like ability to observe fine grained internal behavior. This combination is particularly useful in mircoservice and serverless environments.  In addition, Trace Testing ensure that behavior which is important enough to test in development is also observable in production.  We also propose that formal proof logic – which can catch new classes of bugs and help with live debugging – is not nearly as complicated once you have distributed tracing.\n",

While we started as a single-cloud, SaaS product, we’ve grown to serve huge customers, across clouds and behind customers’ firewalls. With scale came issues in our ability to build, distribute, and manage our product.  CircleCI CTO Rob Zuber will discuss how we hit the limits of distribution via an unsophisticated orchestration engine, and how consolidating on K8s helps us control networking, security, and availability while minimizing one-off work. K8s also allows us to live a value: only building what is a core differentiator to our business.  Even if your team isn’t selling a distributed system, you can apply what we’ve learned. Abstracting your heavy lifting makes it possible to escape the whims of AWS, GCP, or Azure, reduce maintenance, and ultimately, helps drive velocity.\n",

However, Dedicated Game Servers for real time multiplayer games, such as Fortnight, Overwatch, etc, have their own challenges that don’t directly line up with the solutions that Kubernetes natively provide. Game Servers are neither stateless (no Deployments), or ordered stateful (no StatefulSets) - but sit somewhere in between the two. They require direct connections (no load balancers), and can’t be turned off once players are connected to them (no traditional autoscalers).  In this talk we’ll discuss and demo the open source project Agones, developed by Google Cloud Platform in conjunction with Ubisoft. Utilising Kubernetes native extension mechanisms, it attempts to solve this problem by providing a batteries-included solution for running Dedicated Game Servers at scale on Kubernetes.\n",

This talk provides an overview of Cortex, an Open Source project proposed for donation to the CNCF, which takes metrics from multiple Prometheus instances and stores them in a NoSQL database.  Outline: - Microservices architecture of Cortex - NoSQL back-end (DynamoDB, Bigtable or Cassandra) - Fault-tolerance via DHT-based ingestion tier and stateless query tier - Deployment via Kubernetes - Architectural comparison to projects in the same area, such as Thanos and M3 - Lessons learned from operating “Prometheus as a service” for two years\n",

Kubernetes is becoming the standard platform for deploying applications in the enterprise. The Helm project provides tooling for packaging and an extensive catalog of ready to run applications. However, deploying applications in production requires much more: monitoring, logging, certificate management and so on. The community has adopted a de-facto ‘production stack’ that includes popular projects such as Prometheus, Vault, ElasticSearch, Fluentd and others. Unfortunately, putting together this basic plumbing is not standardized, and results in a lot of wasted, duplicated efforts.   This session will introduce the Kubernetes production runtime, an open source stack that can simplify and automate production deployments, and explain how it relates to Knative and Gitlab's Autodevops.\n",

Failing to properly secure your Kubernetes data can result in cloud resources getting hacked and your application secrets getting stolen. The etcd database contains information that may grant an attacker significant visibility into the state of your cluster.  This presentation focuses on how to use the encryption at rest feature to encrypt secret resources in etcd, preventing parties from gaining access to view the content in etcd and etcd backups. Starting from Kubernetes v1.10, we have added --experimental-encryption-provider-config that controls how API data is encrypted in etcd by KMS providers. We will also look at how you can securely leverage KMS providers as stores for your application secrets, keys, and certs.\n",

The solution supports millions of persistent, concurrent connections; enables tens of thousands of messages per second; is globally addressable; stores millions of states; and responds with minimal latency (\u003c250ms). To evaluate build approaches, the team split into Makers \u0026 Breakers. Makers developed the solution stack while Breakers focused on repurposing Locust, a high-scale load testing framework, to simulate behavior. Leveraging the flexibility of Kubernetes, we were able to scale the stack and solve blockers on the path to a viable solution. Blockers included ingress, file descriptors, service discovery and resource limits. The experience was deeply educational, generating key learnings for developers tasked with building a scaled solution on top of Kubernetes.\n",

A vital characteristic of the \"paved roads\" is the automation of the governance process the bank has in place for change management. These are driven by some of the strictest financial regulations in the world. This was achieved by integrating open source tooling such as Grafeas and Kritis into the pipelines to track build metadata and enforce policy.

We introduce NeZha and explain how it improves Kubeflow’s training. Nezha is an open source, community driven, and highly collaborative project, contributed by storage and big data engineers. Nezha is based on Kubernetes Initializer: it rewrites Pod spec, adds a sidecar S3 cache, and redirects Pod to use local cache to accelerate.  Nezha is self contained and easy to use. It does not require modification to existing applications or user visible Pod changes.   Nezha improves big data application performance. Our initial Kubeflow benchmark results using MNIST dataset shows NeZha achieves ~2x speedup.\n",

Seasoned devs know the pain of getting access to essential remote systems, waiting for tests to run (and then fail), or debugging with only log files. This talk teaches you how to best leverage Kubernetes, remote infrastructure and related tooling to create a dev cycle that maximizes velocity and minimizes developer friction and frustration.  Using tools such as Kubernetes, Docker and Telepresence, I will walk attendees through several advanced techniques that can be used to produce an effective developer experience and optimized dev loop. The goal of this is to eliminate many sources of frustrating inefficiency and reduce cycle time between releases. I will demonstrate how to incrementally adopt some of these techniques and how to approach introducing new and unfamiliar technology and techniques to skeptical dev teams.\n",

Join members of SIG-Release as we discuss how the build and release actually works, and what things we’d like to change. This deep dive will describe the state of bazel builds, the release repository and the tooling around release as well as the internal-to-google workings. A member of the Kubeadm team will describe what this process means for their builds, and the Google team will explain the internal tooling they have around builds and releases.

At the same time, the rise of Kubernetes is creating demand for routing, load-balancing \u0026 security infrastructure that is highly scalable, application-aware, and resilient.  Microservices architectures divvy up application functionality into services and expose them via APIs using protocols such as HTTP/REST, gRPC, or Kafka. This creates new challenges. What was previously traditional Layer 3-4 networking security (limited to the IP and port level) now exposes either the entire API surface or none of it. This is insufficient to implement least privilege security for microservices.  This talk introduces the open source project Cilium - built on BPF to provide Linux native networking and least privilege security for microservices while integrating with Kubernetes.\n",

What tools are already provided with Kubernetes, such as taints and tolerances, which tools are plug-ins, such as network policies; and what is missing and requires an external service. He'll briefly cover Nav's build pipelines and why adding in security checks into the docker builds is important to maintaining a compliant environment.  Finally, he'll discuss how moving forward you can reach a point of attaining a state of constant compliance; there is no reason to struggle to \"become\" compliant on a quarterly, or yearly, cadence.\n",

Airflow offers a wide range of native operators for services ranging from Spark and HBase to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Until recently, the Airflow user experience has been hindered by the need to launch and maintain statically-sized Celery-based Airflow clusters. These clusters were both expensive (over and under-utilization) and complex (multiple points of failure).  To address these issues, we developed and published a native Kubernetes Operator and Kubernetes Executor for Apache Airflow. These products allow one-step Airflow deployments, dynamic allocation of Airflow worker pods, full power over run-time environments, and per-task resource management.\n",

Managing state while running systems like Cassandra, Kafka, Spark, Redis, or Tensorflow on Kubernetes is different than with VMs or physical servers.  Let’s examine why we might want to run these systems on Kubernetes, and look at foundational Kubernetes concepts (e.g. Stateful Sets) that help us get those systems up and running. But up and running isn’t always equal to operating correctly. We will go over best practices for managing data-intensive systems on Kubernetes, existing challenges, as well as solutions (e.g. CRDs, custom controllers, operators) and a possible future.  You will learn about operational things to take into account even if you haven't worked with data systems systems on Kubernetes before.\n",

These include parts of our trading system and our document translation system, build and test farms, and artifact caches.  Kubernetes doesn't provide full tenant isolation so users often create per-tenant clusters. Two Sigma has many teams with unique data and service access needs, so such a model would have large overheads. We built multi-tenant clusters by coupling namespace, RBAC and PSPs with Two Sigma’s entitlement system. We also integrated Kerberos via annotations to inject tickets, keytabs, and SSL certs into Pods. We discuss lessons operating this both on-prem and public cloud, including pros and cons of GKE.\n",

When running a cluster there is the option of running a cloud controller manager(CCM) which can make creating resources and creating hardware synonymous. The CCM can provision loadbalancers, set up routes, and tear down vms.   In this talk we will do a deep dive into the different controllers that make up a CCM, and how they are keeping the state of your infrastructure consistent with the clusters resources. The main controllers behind the CCM are cloud agnostic and live in core kubernetes, but each provider has to specify its own implementation. We will examine how provider specific logic hooks into the core and how to leverage the framework to write a custom CCM for any provider or bare metal solution.\n",

While Kubernetes excels in automated application management, more often than not, the state of these applications live outside of Kubernetes. What happens when users develop complex stateful software but still want to benefit from the automation and portability that Kubernetes provides?  In this talk, Celina and Matt share their experience creating an operator for a unique stateful workload: a sharded, replicated, multi-zone time-series database. They discuss the major shift in thought -- from the mental model of a 1:1 process/node relationship, to one far more adaptive to both machine and user behavior.  The audience will walk away with a framework for expressing their stateful workloads using Kubernetes primitives, and advice for navigating the difficult process of codifying innovative abstract ideas without over-engineering solutions.\n",

Network Service Mesh (NSM) is a novel approach solving complicated L2/L3 use cases in Kubernetes that are tricky to address with the existing Kubernetes Network Model. Inspired by Istio, Network Service Mesh maps the concept of a service mesh to L2/L3 payloads. The NSM architecture can be naturally extended to allow interaction of the NSM with the physical network enabling cloud providers to offer value-add services like: Connecting a customers Pod(s) to a network egress specific to that customer Introspecting the Network Service Mesh control messaging to adapt the physical network to serve customer needs better. Allowing customers to request specific physical network services. The NSM community has developed several design patterns for solving problems in K8s that may be of utility to others working in other problem domains in K8s. This talk discusses those design patterns and their benefits.\n",

      "description": "\n  The long term goal of SIG Cloud Provider is to promote a vendor neutral ecosystem for our community. New vendors providing support for Kubernetes should feel equally empowered to do so as any of today’s existing cloud providers. More importantly, SIG Cloud Provider is focused on ensuring a consistent and high-quality user experience across providers. The SIG acts as a central group for developing the Kubernetes project in a way that ensures all providers share common privileges and responsibilities. As Kubernetes transitions from building all binaries necessary to create and run a Kubernetes cluster, to a new world in which Cloud Providers must supply some additional artifacts (Cloud Controller Manager, e.g.) to most effectively run, one area of concern is around how to manage the build and release process effectively. This deep dive session will be a working session to brainstorm how to manage this effectively. Questions for consideration include: - whether and how to include Cloud Provider e2e tests in the suite of release blocking tests for OSS Kubernetes - how to communicate to end users whether they need and how to obtain additional artifacts - how to manage optional addons and extensions in the validation of Kubernetes (e.g., CoreDNS on Kubernetes on N Cloud Providers), when those ecosystem projects evolve on their own release schedules. Session will begin with suggesting and voting on issues of highest level of interest and urgency, and then open discussion on 3 - 5 topics. Recommended for those working on ecosystem projects, those interested in build and release, and those currently working on Cloud Provider implementations.\n",

I will go over how you can see the entire picture of what your system looks like, and with this data, make investigate and triage systematic issues, and make impactful, data-driven, performance optimizations to your system.

There are a variety of ways of measuring how much the different runtimes reduce the Linux kernel attack surface, so this talk makes an assessment of those risks, based on types of code that are blocked, and actual and theoretical attacks. In addition we discuss the threat models for different types of users and code, and look at which types of user should consider these options.

In this session I'll present a practical introduction to the operation of Istio - what features it can bring to your environment.  What's unique about this talk is that we'll be exploring the different parts of Istio by following one plucky little packet into the mesh, through it, and out again. As we meet each component we'll learn why it's there, what it does, and see a demo of how to configure it for common tasks.

This deep dive will review the framework Rook provides to integrate the storage providers with an operator and CRDs. As an example, details of the Ceph operator will be shown, including how it builds on the Rook framework and how Ceph’s specific orchestration needs are met. The Ceph mons require special handling to stay in quorum and handle failover. Ceph OSDs require several stages of discovery and provisioning before the daemons are started. The Ceph mgr runs an active and standby daemon for high availability. For object storage, Rook creates all the pools and starts the rgw daemons needed. For a shared file system, Rook creates the pools and starts the MDS daemon with a standby. These and other challenges with the Ceph daemons will be discussed.\n",

Many dashboards request the entire time range of data from the time series database, every time a dashboard loads or reloads. This can result in slower rendering times, and different results depending on when the request is made. We are proud to announce that Trickster, a new open source project, was developed to address this very issue.Written in Go, Trickster is a reverse proxy cache for the Prometheus HTTP APIv1 that considerably accelerates dashboard rendering times for any series queried from Prometheus. This is possible because of the delta proxy, step boundary normalization, and fast forward features. In the presentation, we will discuss how Trickster was developed at Comcast, and we will show you a live demo of the software.\n",

While k8s can spawn new pods for each notebook session, launching high performance computing (HPC) jobs during dynamic workflows is complicated. Fn is a serverless solution that sits on top of k8s. Individual simulations are deployed as Fn functions that are called dynamically from workflows run within Jupyter notebooks. A notebook running on a lightweight k8s cluster can burst HPC workloads via Fn serverless calls to another cluster running on a bare metal HPC/GPU cloud. Using Fn, we have constructed a distributed access, authentication and accounting layer around a shared object store. This adds security and accountability, thereby making it easy for end users to manage complex multi-cloud workflows involving lots of different types of hardware from within a easy-to-use Jupyter notebook.\n",

Other bits of the controllers may look similar, but have small variations, making it difficult to separate what is bespoke and what is common logic.   The copy/paste approach makes code harder to refactor, understand, and debug. Additionally, neither bug fixes nor improvements to the original are not propagated to the copies.  So what can we about it? Enter controller-runtime, a new foundation library for the next generation of controllers which replaces the boilerplate code with a few function calls.

Containers in a system such as Kubernetes need to be able to communicate, and a common networking solution is to use an overlay network, for example, Flannel. In this talk we aim to 'demystify' container networking, and it's constituent elements such as Linux bridges, veth pairs, routing routes and TUN/TAP devices.   Starting with defining a simple network namespace, we will work through networking between containers on the same machine (using the default docker model), up toward a full overlay network spanning multiple machines (as in Kubernetes). We will explain both how this works and why/when it is required, providing the necessary background for understanding and evaluating common existing Kubernetes networking solutions such as Flannel and Calico.\n",

      "description": "\n  Serverless and FaaS naturally fit microservices architectures. Observability of such systems is very complicated, since each microservice is separated and working asynchronously from the others. Distributed tracing is a key approach to understand such systems. In serverless, there are new challenges and opportunities which make distributed tracing a very interesting and useful technique for high observability.  I will go quickly over the history of tracing and the popular tools. I will focus on the key differences between observability using distributed tracing in generic microservices environments compared to serverless. Examples from the popular cloud vendors will be shown, including full visualization of asynchronous transactions in a highly distributed serverless system, and detecting business flows across multiple asynchronous communication resources (e.g. SNS, Kinesis, and more).\n",

This presentation is very special and will talk about the dangers in using Kubernetes incorrectly. This presentation is drawn on years of real experience reports of providing Kubernetes as a service. We learn about the surprising ways users have used/abused Kubernetes, and how their creative use cases ended up causing catastrophic problems for the rest of the system. A simple example of one of these experience reports is running a large Java application in a docker container in Kubernetes, and how the JVM consumed more memory than the container allocated and ultimately put the node into dead lock. The audience walks away knowing they are not alone in their journey to tackle the new complexities of cloud native application management.\n",

Protocol codecs in combination with custom filters yield benefits ranging from operation-level observability to horizontal scalability via sharding. Using Envoy for this purpose means that enhancements are implemented once and usable across a polyglot stack.

Distributed deployments across heterogeneous infrastructure are increasingly common for cloud native applications. The working group sees common need patterns in cloud-native application architecture to improve the security of the systems. Without common ways to programatically ensure consistent policy, it is increasingly difficult to evaluate system architecture security at scale. We propose that the creation of open source libraries that enable interoperability across software and providers will enable the adoption of common protocols for access control. This will in turn accelerate the adoption of cloud-native application development models, as well as streamline operations for both cloud and traditional infrastructure.\n",

In this presentation, we'll introduce a joint solution from the open source trust cloud-native registry Harbor and the open source intelligent P2P based file distribution system Dragonfly to address the above challenge. The main contents include: 1. Manage your container images in a secure and effective way  2. Distribute your container image in the P2P way by layers  3. Pre-release your container applications from the image registry  4. Let's see the fantastic demo\n",

What would follow is a 5-month journey of building clusters, thrashing with software dependencies, and trudging through erratic performance and scalability issues with the kubernetes API.  How did we decide to use kubernetes? Was it easy to prototype?  Is etcd capable of sustainably servicing 10,000 Jobs an hour? How many Pods can the kubernetes API store? How do you monitor and manage Job failures?  We'll walk you through our lessons learned and talk about our most exciting moments and deflating realizations.

For high availability, each sharded/federated server is configured with an active/standby pair over its load-balancer. A routing map ( a time series) is automatically constructed by each shard server and assembled by the federation server, to direct Prometheus queries to the right servers.

While security is one of its core tenets, Istio has far more potential than simply providing a secure wire transport between services. Its deep knowledge of the application layer, awareness of service concepts, and integrated service authentication mechanisms make it well suited for not just encrypting traffic flows but enforcing a least privilege connectivity model.   In this session, we’ll talk about how putting all these capabilities together can result in a truly Next Gen NGFW that’s not just optimized for cloud native scenarios, but actually delivers better security because of them.\n",

We will also provide a summary of Descheduler. Changes in the cluster size and available resources happen continuously. These changes may make some of the scheduling decisions made before sub-optimal under new conditions. Descheduler monitors clusters and helps fixing previously made scheudling decisions by removing (descheduling) already running Pods when there are better placement opportunities in clusters. We will also talk about the new Pod scheduling policies that allow admins to restrict scheduling properties of Pods.
