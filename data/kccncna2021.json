      "description": "Many teams building highly scalable, cloud-native applications, have struggled with finding a data solution that can keep pace with the needs of their application. Often this has meant a choice between using a managed database, or taking on the task of deploying and managing a database on Kubernetes. Apache Cassandra™ is a powerful database used in many applications that require resilience and scalability, but has traditionally been challenging to deploy and manage effectively. Now the Kubernetes and Cassandra communities have come together in a great collaboration called K8ssandra, a production-ready platform that makes it easy to run Cassandra™ on Kubernetes. In this workshop, you will learn the challenges of managing a data tier in Kubernetes and how to overcome them using K8ssandra.With a primarily hands-on approach, we will cover introductory and in-depth topics that include:Creating a K8ssandra release using HelmMonitoring database performance through metrics and alertsBreaking nodes in the database cluster on purpose to observe self-healingScaling the database resources up and downDeploying applications on top of the database using CQL and REST APIsBacking up and restoring dataMulti region deployment (time and resources permitting)Attendance at this workshop is free.

You’ll learn about our quest of making it possible to tightly couple database changes with application updates by using one of the superpowers we all know from Kubernetes: declarative state operators. Our rag-tag band of do-gooders believes it should be simple to deploy an application update that relies on a database change without building an orchestrated deployment process. All of this should be possible without requiring an intimate knowledge of the schema-migration language required by the specific version of the database that’s running. Kubernetes has proved that declarative desired state works, and SchemaHero is applying this solution to making database schema migrations easier and more reliable.",

This lightweight, fully customizable Kubernetes plugin consists of two parts - preflight and support-bundle. Troubleshoot is capable of collecting, analyzing, and packaging the data needed to get and keep your cluster operating at peak functionality. If it sounds too good to be true, just wait - it gets even better.Join our live lab to see tiny-yet-mighty troubleshoot.sh in action in a live demo, plus the opportunity to learn how to customize troubleshoot components to fit your needs.Some background info:Attendees will be provided with instructions on how to log into a Linux Host running a Kubernetes Application. Attendees will also be provided with step-by-step instructions on how to find and troubleshoot an issue. They will try to login/open a webpage The page will error out/show an error message The attendee will then follow the instructions to fix the issue. (This may involve running some kubectl commands) Once the issue is fixed, the web page should load and allow the participant to sign up for the ring. The attendee will require some Kubernetes knowledge and a laptop that they can use to SSH into a LINUX VM running in GCP.How to Register: In-person registration is sold out (waitlist available).

We can generate an SBoM for container images post build using image scanners like Claire, Trivy, Tern, and Syft. This method is not foolproof, however, as they rely on metadata existing in the container filesystem (such as package manifests) in order to report on them. If a container goes through a multistage build or tools like Docker-slim to reduce the attack surface of the container, all that metadata is gone. How do we get more accurate and consistent SBoMs for containers? We generate them at container build time. This talk demonstrates how we can do that with tools like Tern, Buildah, and the OCI specification. We will get back to the basics of building containers, learn about the OCI specification, and make a container builder which can generate an SBoM at build time.",

However, managing deployments of large numbers of applications/clusters with Argo CD requires complex custom scripting to keep those Applications in sync. The newly released Argo CD ApplicationSet controller aims to solve this problem, by working alongside Argo CD to automatically generate Application deployments using templates and parameterization: manage multiple Kubernetes clusters at once, deploy large numbers of applications from multiples respositories, and more. Best of all, the entire deployment is managed by only a single ApplicationSet Kubernetes custom resource, which means no more juggling of numerous Argo CD Application resources to target those multiple clusters/repos.",

The way Kustomize extensions work has evolved over time towards a model that closely resembles Custom Resources, but on the client side! In this talk, Katrina and Jeff will briefly review the history and future of Kustomize extensions, and then dive into practical applications. The talk will showcase how these CR-style extensions can address common yet idiosyncratic application needs, as well as how platform builders can leverage them to manage declarative configuration at scale.

Dapr is a portable, event-driven runtime that makes it easy for any developer to build resilient, stateless, and stateful applications using any language, targeting any cloud or the edge. Bridge to Kubernetes uses Envoy to extend the Kubernetes perimeter to your development computer allowing you to write, test, and debug microservice code while connected to any Kubernetes cluster with the rest of your application or services. The bridge to microservices harmony can be messy, but a technical deep dive powered by the open-source tooling will have you looking Dapr in no time.",

It has become a roadblock to migrating applications from other cluster management platforms (e.g., YARN) to Kubernetes. Qingcan Wang from Alibaba and Yuan Chen from Apple will present their collaborative work on a Kubernetes enhancement to address the issue. Capacity scheduling offers a similar feature to YARN’s capacity scheduler and enables elastic resource sharing to improve cluster utilization in Kubernetes. It supports hierarchical resource groups with guaranteed and maximum resources for dynamic sharing of resources, from CPU, memory, disk to extended resources like GPU. It is seamlessly integrated into Kubernetes as plugins and has been used in large scale production clusters such as Alibaba Cloud.",

      "description": "Kubernetes emerged as A Good Idea® in part because it gives you real-time, circular feedback: it's a control loop. Something watches, something reacts, equilibrium is maintained. In this talk we’ll discuss how this model is useful not only for orchestrating containers, but for many applications that handle real-time feedback loops. And thanks to Kubernetes, most of the scaffolding for it is already out there, ready to be used. As a use-case the speaker will talk about a development tool that reacts to source code and server status changes in real-time—a perfect match for a Kubernetes-style control loop. Adopting control loops led to a simpler, more modular app. It made the codebase easier to grasp for new developers, and the application as a whole more uniform and easy to extend. Plus, Kubernetes already has a rich ecosystem of tools for it. Lastly, the speaker will discuss other examples in which this model applies and whether this model makes sense for your own applications.",

We will start by covering some common challenges of creating IoT edge workloads. We’ll discuss pros and cons of using traditional containers versus upcoming technologies such as WebAssembly and WASI. Next, we’ll explore mechanisms of deploying built artifacts to the actual hardware, ranging from using different Kubernetes deployments, to simpler container runtimes and specialized Edge platforms. We’ll also focus on the evolving state of running WebAssembly workloads using Kubernetes and how to apply best practices to IoT and edge use cases.

Why did we make this change? Two reasons: cost and efficiency. Restructuring our clusters to support multiple different node types unlocked the ability to run workloads on the best machines for that workload, not just whatever our \"default\" happened to be. However, getting to this point wasn't easy. We'll describe in this presentation changes that were required in almost every part of our infrastructure, from changes to the ways we provision and scale clusters all the way down to changes in the API that our customer teams use.

Cluster management creates opportunity to improve resource utilization which can provide an organization with cost savings. To achieve this, we can make the native Kubernetes scheduler aware of the gap between its declarative resource allocation model and actual node resource utilization. We can pack pods more efficiently in a lower number of nodes considering real load of nodes. Native scheduler on the other hand only considers pod requests and allocable resources on nodes with its default plugins. We introduced two plugins to the scheduler community - TargetLoadPacking and LoadVariationRiskBalancing under the Trimaran framework to address this problem with collaboration between PayPal and IBM.

Gather round your screens and lecterns to hear the story of open source infrastructure helping a tech company sell furniture. We will show how it all happens with Rust and Tremor, and how we tune in and out of what matters; all with a lower cost of infrastructure and maintenance. Tremor users also appreciate the “software-like” syntax of querying through their systems, without sacrificing the performance of Rust. We're proud as supporters of Tremor to integrate OpenTelemetry into our codebase and feature set. We are excited to share details of this integration, how it works, and how we use it at Wayfair. Come to hear bad jokes and good technical content!",

In fact – building smaller services running in pods connected through service meshes are even more vulnerable to bad architectural or implementation choices. To avoid any bad deployments, the CNCF project Keptn provides automated SLO-based Performance Analysis as part of your CD process. Keptn automatically detects architectural and deployment changes that have a negative impact to performance and scalability. It uses SLOs (Service Level Objectives) to ensure your services always meet your objectives. The Keptn team has also put out SLO best practices to identify well known performance patterns that have been identified over the years analyzing hundreds of distributed software architectures deployed on k8s. Join this session and learn what these patterns are and how Keptn helps you prevent them from entering production.",

Recent efforts in the community such as KubeFed address some of the multi-cluster deployment challenges. However, KubeFed currently offers only manual or fully load-balanced placement. Other challenges such as autoscaling and inter-cluster network routing are solved by other projects separately. In this context, we believe there is a need for a more integrated and autonomous approach for managing geo-distributed Kubernetes clusters at scale. In this talk, we will present mck8s -- an extension and partial replacement of KubeFed for geo-distributed computing environments which aims to bring placement, autoscaling, bursting, inter-cluster routing, and cluster provisioning into one package. We will also emphasize its usability and easy adoption by using manifest files very much similar to vanilla Kubernetes.",

From adding simple data types to turning the database into a sharded cluster with a distributed query planner and executor. Yet they are hard to use in a container environment like Kubernetes. Because container images are immutable! So you either pack all possible extensions in a fat container, which leads to substantial problems; or you load dynamically under demand. Join this talk to explore the extension ecosystem in Kubernetes Postgres Operators; and how to solve this problem by introducing a system for dynamically loading extensions into the containers, and cache them within the cluster to avoid excessive downloads.

      "description": "Multi-tenancy is a hot topic in the Kubernetes community. A lot of operators have started to think about lowering cost and consolidating workloads in large, multi-tenant clusters rather than creating 1000s of micro-managed, small clusters. Namespaces are a great way to separate tenants in shared clusters. But what if tenants need to install their own CRDs, run workloads across multiple namespaces or even require different versions of the Kubernetes API server? Virtual clusters are an exciting new approach that extends namespace-based multi-tenancy to address such advanced use cases. At its core, virtual clusters let you run Kubernetes clusters on top of other Kubernetes clusters by provisioning isolated Kubernetes control planes for each tenant (i.e. separate Kube API server, data store (etcd), controller manager etc). This talk will explain how virtual clusters work, show what implementations are available today, and demonstrate fascinating, real-world use cases for virtual clusters.",

While batch processing is optimized for large volumes of data, stream processing allows for real-time analysis. With monitoring workflows aimed at minimizing time to detect incidents, having real-time insights is critical for maintaining reliable cloud-native applications. Monitoring business-critical applications can become difficult at scale. How do you continue processing large volumes of real time data while maintaining valuable insights? There are OSS metrics solutions designed to ingest high volumes of data, but they also need to efficiently aggregate metrics for viewing and analyzing these volumes in real time. This talk will explore how two popular OSS projects, M3 and Thanos, have approached the problem of real time aggregation. The audience will learn how stream and batch processing methodologies have been leveraged by the community to aggregate data in real time, and the tradeoffs of each approach.",

How is the storage mapped to the database or application that uses it? In this talk, we’ll demystify the deployment of databases and stateful workloads in K8s by showing that databases are just applications composed of compute, network and storage. We can deploy them like any other Kubernetes application and take advantage of resources that K8s provides including Storage Classes, Persistent Volumes, Persistent Volume Claims, and Stateful Sets. We will demonstrate how to make it all work by deploying a relational database (MySQL) and a NoSQL database (Apache Cassandra).",

She made the impossible and necessary decision to stop working in order to recover, setting out on what became four months of self-discovery. Julia will talk about what what led her to this state, what it looked like, and how she was able to get the necessary help to feel strong enough to not only go back to work, but to shift career paths all together as a hopeful and positive outcome that arose out of dark times.

This talk will propose a novel approach to build AIoT applications using Kubernetes. Using an illustrative reference architecture, the talk will explain emergent AIoT behaviors and architecture patterns. Such patterns can help in deciding what open source projects to choose for AIoT solutions. You will also see a demo simulating an industrial IoT setting where sensors measure conditions in real-time and feed them to an edge device. The device uses a TPU accelerator to apply logistic regression to predict future equipment breakdown. You will see how ML pipelines measure drift and re-train and re-deploy the model.",

A single Flux install can now work with many parts of multiple git repositories, and Flux is more usable and observable than ever. The project has first-class support for popular technologies like Kustomize, Helm, Prometheus, SOPS, GitHub, and GitLab, and it provides extension points in all areas to integrate with other technologies and platforms, much like Kubernetes itself. This session will consist of a cool 15 minute demo of common and novel Flux use-cases that show just much progress the community has made.

These projects run unconventional workloads which often have quite different needs to running vanilla deployments. They often need to manage large amounts of data, manage massive parallelism, and special lifecycle requirements, none of which Kubernetes provides by default. In this talk, you’ll hear from the technical leads on the Tekton and Argo projects about how they’ve pushed the boundaries of Kubernetes to provide this new functionality.

In this session, Kohei and Tao introduce state-of-the-art OCI-alternative image formats discussed in the community for speeding up pulling images, especially putting the focus on eStargz and nydus. These formats enable \"lazy pulling\" that allows container runtime to startup a container without waiting for the entire image. Over the past year, lazy pulling has been available on more and more container-related tools including Kubernetes, containerd, CRI-O, Podman, BuildKit, etc. So they will show how widely these image formats can be used on these tools in daily activity. eStargz has been proposed to OCI Image Specification as an extension and nydus has so to the next version of that spec (a.k.a. OCIv2). The talk will also share the discussion status.",

One way is to ensure that personal information is hidden, on the fly, without introducing lag. Seems like a tall order, but it can be done. This talk presents a Cloud Native Serverless architecture to ensure real time data anonymization, using KEDA and Rook. Specifically, we have extended Ceph to support AWS SQS compatible APIs and developed an external Scaler in KEDA to allow Serverless functions to query, pull, and anonymize objects. This architecture is lightweight, reliable, and scalable. More importantly, the queue trigger mechanism in this architecture does not require us to expose external endpoints to Serverless functions that could become additional attack surfaces. This talk will demo an open source Serverless workflow based on the above technologies. It uses object detection AI models to anonymize images that are produced by Edge workloads.",

A better approach is to look at some commonly used metrics as a starting point for learning about which parts of your project are doing well and identifying areas for improvement. The challenge is that there are many possible metrics, so the real value is in selecting the right metrics and interpreting them. Every CNCF project is a little different, and you’ll need to interpret your metrics in ways that make sense for your project. This talk will cover: * Finding data for some commonly used metrics, including responsiveness, contributor activity and risk, project velocity, inclusivity, and more * Things to think about when interpreting these metrics for your project * Best practices for measuring and improving project health The audience will walk away with practical advice for measuring and improving the health of their CNCF projects.",

      "description": "KServe (previously known as KFServing) is a serverless open source solution to serve machine learning models. With machine learning becoming more widely adopted in organizations, the trend is to deploy larger numbers of models. Plus, there is an increasing need to serve models using GPUs. As GPUs are expensive, engineers are seeking ways to serve multiple models with one GPU. The KServe community designed a Multi-Model Serving solution to scale the number of models that can be served in a Kubernetes cluster. By sharing the serving container that is enabled to host multiple models, Multi-Model Serving addresses three limitations that the current ‘one model, one service’ paradigm encounters: 1) Compute resources (including the cost for public cloud), 2) Maximum number of pods, 3) Maximum number of IP addresses. 4) Maximum number of services This talk will present the design of Multi-Model Serving, describe how to use it to serve models for different frameworks, and share benchmark stats that demonstrate its scalability.",

This points to the container-in-a-vm model: the VM for isolation, and the container to seamlessly integrate with the orchestrator. But is this optimal for deployments where containers are not a requirements? Is it possible to use VMs for isolation, use Kubernetes and all of its wide array of features for orchestration, but without having to rely on containers? In this talk we will present KubeKraft, a novel runtime along with modifications to containerd that allow for running VMs with Kubernetes *natively*, without any container overhead. We will present KubeKraft's architecture, its integration with Kubernetes and will show performance results; for instance, when using a Unikraft NGINX unikernel (less than 2MBs in size) KubeKraft results in 2x the throughput of an official Docker NGINX image (42M image size).",

As cluster operators, building confidence in the changes being made is key to allowing frequent updates without compromising on reliability. Running the full Kubernetes conformance test suite every time is generally too slow, and doesn't always cover the functionality users of clusters care about. In this talk, you will learn how Skyscanner uses Kubernetes' existing test codebase along with Sonobuoy and Spinnaker to build a custom test suite. This allows cluster operators to build confidence in changes made to their clusters and their components, focussing on the functionality developers care about. This case study will enable you to make a start in developing your own tests for Kubernetes clusters, understanding the benefits this can bring, as well as the drawbacks you need to beware of.",

Gopay has heavily adopted Kubernetes to run its hundreds of microservices and has very recently migrated to a service mesh based architecture. As we grow, our infrastructure was becoming more complex and fragmented, our engineers less productive. Instead of writing code, teams were constantly interrupted by migration requests and spending more time looking for the right information just to get started. \"Why do I need to migrate to newer helm chart again, I just upgraded it!\" \"This service isn’t responding, who owns it?\" This talk will guide you how we fulfilled those challenges and fasten service mesh adoption through a developer friendly platform.

But, how to strike a balance between energy efficiency and service performance for container operations due to the continuous growth of IoT devices and edge computing systems? The current K8s does not provide container orchestration from the perspective of data center power reduction. This talk presents a Workload Allocation Optimizer (WAO) based on the K8s architecture. WAO uses ML to predict the power increasing of workloads and introduces a scoring plugin to the K8s scheduler framework for Node selection. WAO-load balancer enables Pods to Nodes assignment with optimal power consumption. This talk gives you details on how power saving can be realized for cloud-edge computing systems. Instead of using the virtual environment, we demonstrate the proposed WAO in a real edge data center with 200+ servers and show you how WAO manipulates the tradeoff between service performance and data center power saving.",

This is an unsurprising request. However, the solutions to these problems today are surprisingly inadequate, especially when security and compliance are considered. This problem stems from cloud providers/services each having their own notion of workload identity and schema, which makes federation difficult. This talk proposes a shift in the perspective of workload identity from being “platform specific” to “organization wide” using SPIFFE/SPIRE and the new SPIFFE Tornjak project to provide a consistent and secure organization-wide management plane for workload identity and access across multiple clouds. After all, user identities are managed on the organization level (e.g. LDAP, etc.), why should our handling of workload identities be any different?",

While existing open source projects like Karmada, Tensile-Kube, Liqo, Admiralty, and more have addressed challenges in multi-cluster management such as configuration, lifecycle management, they either introduce new APIs/management workflows or have scalability limitations in terms of scheduling throughput. In this talk, a new Clusterless design is introduced to reduce the management burden of multi-cluster users. Basically, multiple clusters are abstracted as Pod resource providers, connecting to a management cluster which is exposed to the users. There are no new APIs introduced hence the consistent user experiences are preserved. The Pod dispatching is done by a highly efficient two-level scheduling algorithm which can achieve O(n) scheduling throughput, where n is the number of managed clusters.",

Many of these open-source serverless solutions actually operate at the level of the container abstraction, which makes them a powerful bridge for traditional application models, but sacrifices the simplicity of the \"functions\" approach. Function buildpacks aim to provide this developer simplicity by injecting both a main method and invocation glue such as an HTTP server into the application code before building a container image. Unlike traditional buildpacks which aim to package a complete application with specific protocol bindings specified by the developer, function buildpacks rely on inversion of control to adapt business logic (in the form of a CloudEvents-processing function) to the protocol needs of the application.",

This effort has brought us from ~20% of endpoints conformance tested in 1.15 to over 75% by 1.22. Most of the success can be attributed to the tooling developed to streamline the process of locating new endpoints to test before creating a PR to the Kubernetes repo. The tooling helps with identifying the current gaps in conformance, exploring endpoints, writing tests and verifying the test results. In this presentation Stephen will walk us through the tooling that will help us test the remaining 25% of the Kubernetes API.",

Thanos has been made to enable scaling, highly available setups and long term (cheap) storage for Prometheus. Everyone could leverage Thanos for these features. It does not stop there; Thanos has multiple components that could be used for multi-cluster telemetry, remote writes, and multi-tenancy. We want to introduce everyone to Thanos.

To fix this situation, CNCF and Prometheus team have launched the Prometheus Conformance Program. We will walk through its design, through current test suites available, through current test results, and show you how to apply for the official mark of Prometheus compatibility.

In this talk, they will show you how easy it is to use the kubernetes control plane to create control loops that can automate the SDLC of your company . They will also show you how to build an extensible PaaS platform on top of Kubernetes and your company's existing processes that does not constraint the users, but allows the service owners to see through the abstraction.

Even code with the same business logic needs two separate implementations. Fugue is an open-source abstraction layer that solves this. In this talk, he'll show how Fugue lets users port native Python code to Spark or Dask with minimal code changes. By using Fugue, data science code will be written in a framework-agnostic and scale-agnostic manner that allows it to be ported to different execution environments. This will be demonstrated by showing how to scale data compute from a single machine to a Spark cluster set-up on Kubernetes.",

Ultimately, understanding how your systems behave and why is a data analytics problem. Like most data analytics problems, the trick is in collecting and wrangling the right data sources.In this talk, you will learn how Pixie, an open-source observability platform for Kubernetes, can be used to painlessly turn low-level telemetry data into high-level signals about system health.

While cloud providers usually have solutions to migrate data to their own cloud, Workday aims to be cloud-agnostic, and as such needs a solution to migrate data cross-clouds. The infrastructure, platform, and application development teams cooperated to develop a solution relying on Kubernetes operators, Istio, Consul, and Helm-delivered application configuration. This talk will give an overview of the tools and technologies used to migrate tenant data to other clusters, wherever they are deployed.

As it turns out, having VPP’s flexible and modular userspace networking stack in a Kubernetes environment enables all sorts of interesting things -- such as allowing network-intensive pods to send and receive data at ludicrous speeds while conserving the CNI features we love, thanks to kernel bypass. This is useful for any workload that spends most of its time doing network I/O. Think proxy, content delivery server, or network functions such as VPN endpoints.

With over 100 Terabyte of daily Git data, regional GKE clusters provide the convenience of spanning multiple availability zones for redundancy, but cross availability zone egress was a concern.

In these scenarios a message is sent to the server, which makes a routing decision based on the information inside the message. At that point a reroute request is send to the client that redirect its calls to the assigned backend, In this presentation, Renana Yacobi, Server Core Infrastructure Lead @ Niantic, presents a context aware routing, using the power of Envoy custom filters and partial message parsing to use information extracted from the message payload to route the traffic while supporting legacy APIs.",

      "description": "For most of Kubernetes history, the edge of the cluster was always a hard boundary that was difficult to traverse. Single clusters can scale up with huge node pools and extensive geographic coverage; but many users prefer to use multiple Kubernetes clusters. This gives them more control, with isolated workloads, manageable latency, and clear data jurisdictions, reducing the effort to provide reliable platforms. However that isolation requires a lot of work to access services from one cluster in another. By using the Multicluster Services API, an OSS standard sponsored by SIG-Multicluster, users with an application spread across multiple clusters can make services available between them using simple Kubernetes object primitives available as CRDs, without needing to install a full service mesh. In this talk, we will explain the concepts and architecture behind the MCS API and walk through demos on Submariner.io and GKE, the two current implementations of the MCS API.",

The costs incur from the runtime of the assigned virtual machines - whether they are well utilized or not - as opposed to paying for the runtime of the containers. This is one of many adoption insights in terms of \"hidden costs\". In this talk Matthias and Thorsten describe their experience about those costs based on the experience of adopting CaaS in several client scenarios. In most cases it was set-up to achieve a \"PaaS-like\" self-service developer experience.

      "description": "If you write OSS software, you may have noticed that it can be surprisingly difficult to provide logs and metrics to the users who run your libraries. OpenTelemetry is designed to solve this problem. OpenTelemetry allows OSS projects – web frameworks, databases, message queues – to move beyond testing and begin to participate in runtime observability, while still giving their end users control over where and how the data is processed. In this session, we will cover: The benefits of OpenTelemetry instrumentation. Guidelines for natively instrumenting your OSS library. Tricky parts, gotchas, and how to minimize them. We will also briefly cover the current state of OpenTelemetry project: Which APIs are currently stable, and what long term support means. Methods for combining tracing and metrics to simplify instrumentation. How to get involved with the native instrumentation effort in OpenTelemetry.",

Each function execution outcome might depend on an OS state which is not exposed to a user and is not visible with traditional Linux networking tooling. And those tools can’t tell you how network packets relate to K8s pods and services. Luckily, with the help of eBPF we no longer need to treat Linux kernel networking in the context of K8s as a big blackbox. In this talk DevOps who operate K8s clusters will learn: - Packet inspection across layer 2, layer 3 and policy routing, socket, and so on, regardless of the CNI. - How eBPF can be used to efficiently troubleshoot K8s networking issues. - Real-life examples of K8s networking problems and how they were debugged with eBPF.

      "description": "Spotify began offering a centralized Kubeflow Pipelines product to its machine learning teams around two years ago. Since then, adoption has skyrocketed, with more teams training more models and running increasingly complex experiments. These increased demands on our system come with more stringent demands on us, the Kubeflow team at Spotify, to ensure not just cluster reliability, but cluster equitability. Our job is to not just be cluster maintainers, but cluster stewards—ensuring equitable and reliable access to cluster resources, and keeping users from stepping on each others’ toes. In this talk, we’ll discuss our streamlined tooling to maintain, deploy, and monitor Spotify’s distribution of Kubeflow. We’ll illustrate the challenges we face as we scale to increased user load and increasingly distinct and demanding pipelines, and outline our approach to addressing those challenges with “multi-cluster” Kubeflow. Finally, we’ll give a preview of our future plans for the platform.",

      "description": "One of Kubernetes’ most powerful features is its declarative API, where the cluster is defined by its intended state. This transfers the responsibility to reconcile the intended and actual state from the user to the cluster. But it’s likely that users are also running workloads outside of Kubernetes, from databases to virtual machines— and they might be using multiple cloud providers at once. How to manage it all? In this talk, the speakers explore how Kubernetes’ declarative model can be used to manage cloud-hosted resources alongside their Kubernetes workloads. They will demonstrate this, first using Crossplane, a Kubernetes add-on with native multi-cloud support, and second, using custom controllers built by different cloud providers. Finally, they will show how to integrate OpenPolicyAgent with cloud-hosted resource definitions, to enforce custom policies across environments. Attendees will leave this talk ready to simplify their cloud configuration with Kubernetes.",

      "description": "eBPF being a promising technology is no news, but for a long time eBPF has struggled with portability, it needed to be compiled for each kernel, or a compiler and kernel headers needed to be shipped executing effectively arbitrary code. The eBPF community acknowledged this and started the CO:RE (compile once-run everywhere) initiative, which is young but quickly maturing in the form of libbpf. Parallel to it, we are discovering more and more use cases where eBPF can be useful, especially when combined with Go and Kubernetes, from security, over observability to performance tuning. In this talk, Frederic will explain what libbpf does in order to achieve compile once-run everywhere, how it can be used in Go, and lastly how to bridge the low-level Kernel features to higher-level Kubernetes concepts like Pods, and demonstrate all of it with real-life examples to help measure and improve performance systematically.",
