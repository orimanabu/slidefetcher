If you’ve defined a Secret resource in Kubernetes before, you know how effortless it is just to reuse that secret. This ease of use is Kubernetes benefit but has a massive underlying issue: Kubernetes Secrets are anything but genuinely secret. Sure, they’re stored Base64 encoded, but who doesn’t already know that? Since Kubernetes Secrets can be easily reused and read, your secrets might be just one bad commit away from being leaked to the world.This workshop, led by Justin Mitchel of Coding for Entrepreneurs, teaches you to deploy a self-hosted HashiCorp Vault for efficient Kubernetes secret management.Prerequisites: A working knowledge of Kubectl and access to provision resources on a running cluster.What’s included:$250 in free cloud computing services credit for Akamai CloudA paper-back copy of the Manning book “Road to Kubernetes” by Justin MitchelOne Rocketbook ProSoft drinks, coffee, and refreshments throughout the workshopBuffet lunch by Portillo’s  Want a preview of the training?

This ease of use is Kubernetes benefit but has a massive underlying issue: Kubernetes Secrets are anything but genuinely secret. Sure, they’re stored Base64 encoded, but who doesn’t already know that? Since Kubernetes Secrets can be easily reused and read, your secrets might be just one bad commit away from being leaked to the world.This workshop, led by Justin Mitchel of Coding for Entrepreneurs, teaches you to deploy a self-hosted HashiCorp Vault for efficient Kubernetes secret management.Prerequisites: A working knowledge of Kubectl and access to provision resources on a running cluster.What’s included:$250 in free cloud computing services credit for Akamai CloudA paper-back copy of the Manning book “Road to Kubernetes” by Justin MitchelOne Rocketbook ProSoft drinks, coffee, and refreshments throughout the workshopBuffet lunch by Portillo’s  Want a preview of the training?

Security and operations teams have tools for packaging and signing application artifacts, and they need the same capabilities for OPA policies. This lighting talk will describe how to build, tag, and sign OPA policies as OCI containers using the policy CLI. Policy CLI is an open source tool that is part of Open Policy Containers (OPCR), a CNCF sandbox project. Policy CLI can be used to pull and push OPA policies OCI-compliant registries, such as GHCR, Docker, or AWS Container Registry.

      "description": "The explosion of complexity in the Cloud Native Landscape is driving a need to create higher level abstractions and APIs. We will demo using generative AI to simplify building and consuming these abstractions. Our demo uses an LLM to automatically generate a KRM function(“client side CRD”) . Given a description of a configuration change, e.g. “change the registry of all docker images”, the agent automatically generates the Go code to make that change. We also use an LLM to turn a NL description of the transformations to be applied into KRM invocations Generative AI significantly lowers the cost of building and maintaining abstractions specific to an organization. Using AI a platform engineer can generate minimally useful code in minutes without having to learn frameworks like Kubebuilder. Platform engineers can also use AI to create human centric APIs that are easier for platform consumers.",

      "description": "The best data science is “human-in-the-loop” data science—blending the strengths of human and machine. As the human, your time is best spent thinking deeply about data and crafting Machine Learning (ML) models, while the machine efficiently cranks on your models. In this talk, the speakers will present a fresh paradigm—interactive data science at scale. The speakers will merge two open-source tools, Jupyter and Kubeflow to demonstrate a unique, “human-in-the-loop” AI/ML workflow. They will leverage Jupyter’s world-class interactive computing tools and Kubeflow’s innovative, cloud-native scaling technologies to develop, tune, train, and deploy massive ML models. The speakers will highlight key features in both projects that dramatically enhance and simplify the way humans do data science. Finally, they will end with demonstrating Jupyter’s new real-time collaboration experience—because two (or more) “humans-in-the-loop” are better than one.",

Rather than tackling the problem, it was left for the ecosystem to solve. Today, we seek to make Kubernetes' support for multi-network easier, more complete, and in-tree. Maciej and Doug will introduce you to the Kubernetes PodNetwork construct. It will enable explicit segmentation of traffic at the Pod level, allowing definition and use of multiple networks, logical or physical, which coexist in one cluster and enable integration with existing Kubernetes concepts like Services. These features are required for telecom and high-performance computing use-cases, especially for isolation, performance, and security – and interest grows more broadly for multi-tenancy, and separation of networks by Namespace. Together we’ll explore architecture and API changes for Pod interfaces as Kubernetes elements. We invite you to participate in unifying advanced networking technology in Kubernetes.",

What's more, these Wasm applications can be authored in multiple programming languages and frameworks, so its content and business logic can be extended to whatever you are most comfortable writing in. All in all, after building applications to Wasm, we will show how to package Wasm components to containers, and, lastly, we will deploy our work to environments like on-prem, cloud, and hybrid cloud using Kubernetes. Overall, you will leave the room having learned the pros and cons of using Wasm and how to build production-ready Wasm applications.",

Seeing GPL licensed code may give some licensing compliance teams pause because eBPF is unfamiliar to them - but it shouldn’t. This talk provides context around why the GPL licensed eBPF code exists and isn't a licensing hazard for the rest of the project.

Unfortunately, global replication is not easy; not just because of the difficulty in consistency reasoning that it introduces, but also due to the increased cost of provisioning multiple volumes that exponentially duplicate ingress and egress. Wouldn't it be great if our systems could learn the optimal placement of storage blocks so that total replication was not necessary? Wouldn't it be even better if our replication messaging was reduced ensuring communication only between the minimally necessary set of storage nodes? We show a system that uses multi-armed bandits to perform such an optimization; dynamically adjusting how data is replicated based on usage.

However, threat actors are outpacing our innovation — rule-based detections focus on what we think attackers will do, not on what they are doing and generate enough alerts to bury security analysts in a sandstorm of poor signal-to-noise. Can this dynamic be blown back to shift the information asymmetry in favor of defenders? This advanced talk will focus on how to create high-value, kernel signals that are difficult to bypass using eBPF and Falco - but not in the traditional way. Advanced data analytics is an emerging crosswind that enables us to soar past attackers by detecting deviations in current behavior from past behavior. I’ll discuss rules versus behavior challenges and push the boundaries of innovation through demos that scale in real-world production environments. Come join me as we take this zephyr of an idea into a jet stream of change for threat detection!",

      "description": "In the OWASP API Security Top 10 2023, three of the top 5 vulnerabilities include the word \"authorization (authz)\", authz is becoming more important for security considerations. Authz is often developed from scratch, however, along with the expanded service, the authz logic often becomes low scalability due to the increase in authz targets, attributes, and combinations. In such cases, it is common to introduce an authz service. Keycloak, an IAM OSS, also has an authz service. Keycloak has OAuth2 authz server capabilities, too, so by using the authz service, it is possible to centrally manage data related to authentication (authn) and authz. In this session, Yoshiyuki Tabata explains how to implement scalable authz using Keycloak and how to combine it with OPA to avoid Keycloak becoming SPOF and improve authz performance. Furthermore, by combining with CockroachDB, he introduces an authn and authz solution that withstands regional failures and operates in multi-cloud environments.",

AI containers are often 10’s of gigabytes large, which greatly impacts the total workload startup time. We will show how you can optimize your Kubernetes platform to pre-load containers and greatly reduce your workload startup times. We will discuss additional techniques to reduce overall startup times and optimize your auto scaling performance. Lastly, we will explore further challenges to solve to get AI job cold startup time from 15 minutes to 1 min, by evolving the container runtime (especially in ContainerD).",

This talk introduces runwasi, an open-source library to develop containerd shims that leverage WebAssembly and the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI). Together, Wasm and Runwasi enable deployment of secure, lightweight apps whenever you can run containers. Thanks to the sandboxed execution environment, the workloads get an extra isolation layer. The capability-based security model that WASI follows ensures the functions only have access to the required resources. Application distribution is another challenge. Wasm modules are small and compact (20MB for a Python Wasm module).

This talk introduces how Security Behavior Analytics (SBA) technology can detect exploit delivery sent during client interactions. Guard, a CNCF Knative component running on Kubernetes, uses SBA to detect unusual behavior that indicates potential exploit delivery. Guard applies Machine Learning (ML) to establish per-service criteria and does not rely on specific signatures that can be outdated or missed. We cover the benefits and disadvantages of using SBA with ML. We demonstrate Guard in action, blocking an actual exploit, and discuss security operations in production, and the relationship with Zero-Trust Architecture.",

      "description": "When architecting secure Kubernetes deployments it is often desirable to isolate the various streams of network traffic that exist within a cluster. For user-initiated traffic this process involves proxies and well-crafted firewall rules, but how do you properly separate API server-initiated traffic that flows to pods, nodes, and service networks?Konnectivity Proxy simplifies this question by providing a common methodology for shaping the network egress traffic from Kubernetes API servers. Securing network traffic within Kubernetes clusters is a vital step to ensure that user data is protected and that cloud resources are not exploited. Project maintainers will cover an overview of the Konnectivity proxy, the goals of this project as a collaboration between SIG Cloud Provider and SIG API Machinery, its current status, and will share experiences running Konnectivity at GKE. Attendees will leave with new knowledge and tools to secure their Kubernetes clusters.",

TAG Security regularly conducts security assessments to examine the security of CNCF projects. Compared to audits, the assessment is often detached from a specific deployment and the implementation itself. an assessment focuses more on design flaws and whether a software project as a whole is doing the sorts of things that lead to security. This will be an accessible, light, and (hopefully) fun talk. We will delve into the assessment process, the incisiveness of the review, look at prior assessments, and showcase some computer programs. We will share attack matrixes and results from the assessments of different projects and how assessments have influenced project security.

It moves away from the limited \"countable\" interface for requesting access to resources (e.g. \"nvidia.com/gpu: 2\"), providing an API more akin to that of persistent volumes. In the context of GPUs, this unlocks a host of new features without the need for awkward solutions shoehorned on top of the existing device plugin API. These features include: * Controlled GPU Sharing (both within a pod and across pods) * Multiple GPU models per node (e.g. T4 and A100) * Specifying arbitrary constraints for a GPU (min/max memory, device model, etc.) * Dynamic allocation of Multi-Instance GPUs (MIG) * … the list goes on ...

But carving out the time to add instrumentation to a codebase can seem daunting, and is often treated as a separate task to writing features. This means that we end up instrumenting for observability long after a feature has shipped, usually when there’s a problem with it and we’ve lost all the context. What if we instead treated observability similarly to how we treat tests? We wouldn't submit our code without a test. Let’s do the same with observability. Treat it as part of the feature while the code is still fresh in our mind, with the benefit of being able to observe how the feature is behaving in production. We’ll cover practical ways to instrument during development so it feels like a natural part of the development workflow. Because if you know how to log, you know how to trace.",

However, the current autoscaling is limited to a single cluster even when using multi-clusters. If we can break through the cluster boundaries, there will be some awesome scenarios, including scaling across clusters to extend resources infinitely, scaling up workloads in the local IDC first before the public cloud to save costs, and so on. To bring the benefits of autoscaling across clusters to users, we designed and implemented two types of multi-cluster HPA: centralized and distributed. They are different and have their own appropriate scenarios. In this session, Wei and XingYan will go over: 1. The challenges, benefits, and scenarios of autoscaling across clusters. 2. How we implement them in Karmada to solve the challenges. 3. How to select the appropriate type for different scenarios and example demonstrations.",

It’s everywhere and it seems like it solves all of the problems. But do you actually need it? What are the core functions of service mesh and how do I choose a technology? And how can I be sure to use the technology in an efficient way so that I don’t introduce unneeded complexity and reliability issues. In this session, we will dig into Service Mesh in detail and break down the common use cases and discuss best practices to use it to your advantage. We will review common pitfalls and talk about how Service Mesh fits into the journey through Cloud Native technologies. Of course, there will be demos!",

      "description": "If you’ve worked with VMs on Kubernetes, you’re familiar with how far they are behind the rest of the container ecosystem. This is caused by the different requirements around the way that VMs are started and migrated, which doesn’t match up with way we handle these things in the Kubernetes world. Outside of Kubernetes, existing legacy hypervisor solutions require VMs to be shutdown before migration, resulting in significant downtime. Even if they support live migration, that process is usually slow, error-prone, requires extensive preparation, and cuts networking during migration. These challenges make it difficult for legacy, stateful applications to leverage Kubernetes. This talk will dive into how we use r3map to solve these issues by providing stateful applications with the same UX that developers expect from containers by speeding up migrations, enabling persistent network connections, and guaranteeing zero downtime.",

Helm stands out from other tools by also being a de-facto package manager for Kubernetes. To win this title, the Helm provides a lot of additional features. Besides just generating YAML, Helm supports dependencies, release tracking, and even orchestrates pre and post-deployment tasks. Wait, Argo CD also provides similar features! So what is the right way to use Helm with Argo CD and avoid redundancy? In this talk, we will explain how exactly Argo CD and Helm are working together and cover the best practices for integrating the two.

MetalLB integration acts as a load balancer for the services running inside a bare-metal Kubernetes cluster, distributing network traffic evenly among the various nodes of the cluster hosting the service instances.

To protect against this threat, the cybersecurity community has created a suite of new quantum-safe encryption which the NIST has chosen as part of their post-quantum cryptographic standard. So, how do we adopt these tools and standards in Kubernetes? In this talk, Paul and Max will sketch the steps to safeguard Kubernetes against attacks on classical encryption using quantum-safe technologies.

Additionally, eBPF empowers us to reshape traffic at a low level with XDP, which delivers high-performance programmable packet processing seamlessly integrated with the kernel. This revolutionary impact extends to the Kubernetes networking landscape, as eBPF serves as the core technology behind projects like Cilium and its CNI plugin that provides high-performance network capabilities, but such powerful technologies remain enigmatic for many. The objective of this workshop is to dive into the inner workings of these technologies, participants will learn the basics of eBPF and CNI, and they will gain hands-on experience in creating a CNI plugin for Kubernetes utilizing eBPF, demystifying the underlying mechanics of eBPF-based projects.",

Through contributing to open source projects over the last few years, I’ve learned a few lessons about how open source communities work. We're all human and we all want good code and good support for our code. In this session I’ll talk about what it was like to start contributing to a big open source project, and the lessons I learned along the way that eventually led to becoming an approver on a repository that I contributed to.",

For example, training of large ML models requires efficiently managing a significant number of expensive accelerators, and building on-demand HPC systems can mean composing applications and services. For both, efficient job orchestration is critical to ensure scalability and high resource utilization. This talk introduces the JobSet API (sigs.k8s.io/jobset) that lays the foundation to automate the setup of these designs. We will first demonstrate how JobSet is used to deploy training workloads using common frameworks like Pytorch, and present results from large scale training experiments on thousands of TPU chips. We then show using JobSet to automate the arduous task of setting up HPC systems on-demand, and creating common environments for experimental comparison.",

But how should they behave if the application itself relies on its own distributed process orchestration ? How should controllers and clients be designed when jobs are scaling up to 10.000 pods or more ? Traditional HPC software represents a perfect storm of all the aspects that may push its portability to the limit: unique assumptions, high cardinality of processes distributed across contended nodes and cores, heavy memory, cpu and network footprint. This talk will present some of the fundamental operator design patterns behind the successful integration of established HPC software into large managed production clusters.

However, unlike most APIs, those that call LLMs are non-deterministic and inherently unreliable. So how do we know that it's doing what we need? What are the different factors that matter to our users, and how can we measure them? Subtle changes to a prompt in an LLM can have huge changes on its behavior, so how do we understand the impact of our prompt changes? We asked all these questions and more during development, and we think we have a good way to answer them through careful instrumentation and Observability practices. In this talk, I'll go through how we instrumented our feature, what we tracked, what SLOs we set up, and how we measured our improvements as we iterated on the feature.

They allow operators to visualize the system performance and to understand if something is going wrong. Some metrics are rather easy to collect as they are exposed by the different user space applications. On the other hand, collecting operating-system level metrics is challenging: many times, the metrics of interest are not exposed, or collecting them is very expensive. eBPF is a powerful and efficient technology that allows us to get deep visibility into the operating system. eBPF programs are executed in the kernel context making it possible to collect low-level metrics like packet and bytes counters, IO operation latency, system calls invocations, etc. In this presentation, Mauricio will present the fundamental concepts around metrics, eBPF and how they are related.

Time is limited and stakes are high, as this isn’t just a “live demo” for the masses. Over the course of twenty minutes, competitors will attempt to resolve a broken cluster, or deploy a service to production. At the end of the time, entries will be judged on four categories. Each category will be rated on Stability, Resiliency, Flexibility, and Observability. Participants won’t know what challenge they’ll be given ahead of time, but will be informed whether certain cloud resources or APIs will need to be enabled and available. Pre-creating any helpful scripts, code, or cloud resources is strictly prohibited. During the competition, the Scheduler will bounce between the participants' screens, engage with the audience, and ask questions of the participants live. Join us, root on our competitors, and feel free to engage live!",

Justifiably, everybody is looking for ways to maximize revenue from their open-source investments. In this talk, the speakers will share their experiences of building cloud-native communities, startup (mis)adventures, and monetising with CNCF projects. Learn from Kiran what it takes to build projects like OpenEBS and LitmusChaos, and anecdotes from his startup venture - sustaining through acquisitions and economic downturns. Anusha will shed light on the intricacies of startups that offer enterprise versions of open-source projects (e.g., Kyverno) - the pricing game, the wild race to hit the market, pivoting product strategies, and much more!",

How do Kubernetes control plane components manage a network they themselves run within, and how does a coherent network even come to exist between cluster nodes in the first place? Maybe most importantly, *how* can you figure out what's wrong with any of it?

      "description": "In this talk, we show how you can simulate scheduling in a large Kubernetes cluster without breaking the bank. Pod scheduling is one of the trickiest parts of Kubernetes infrastructure to get right. Done correctly, it can have enormous benefits in terms of cost and efficiency; done poorly, it can cause outages or lasting damage to your bottom line. The Kubernetes scheduler comes with a host of parameters that you can tune to control its behaviour, as well as allowing users to inject custom plugins at almost every stage of the scheduling process. In a large-scale cluster, the interactions between all these knobs can lead to unexpected emergent behaviour that is nearly impossible to reason about. To simulate this, we use a virtual kubelet that presents itself as a fully-configurable, low-overhead Kubernetes node object. In this presentation we show how to use this technique to collect data about scheduling decisions that are made for a variety of different kube-scheduler parameters.",

      "description": "Deploying LLMs is challenging. This talk is a case study in how cloud native technologies, specifically Kubernetes and OCI artifacts, simplifies private LLM deployments. Allowing teams to run models in their infrastructure solves significant data governance \u0026 security challenges. However, it is still difficult to efficiently share large artifacts between model developers and model consumers. Autumn and Marwan share how open standards unblocked challenges and simplified LLM delivery. First, we explore how Kubernetes made it possible to rapidly deliver a highly portable, cloud-native inference stack. Second, OCI Artifacts have been underutilized as a delivery mechanism for artifacts beyond container images. We explore how we achieved significant efficiency gains by reducing duplicate storage, increasing download speed, and minimizing governance overhead. Walk away learning how you can leverage Kubernetes and OCI in your MLOps journey.",

In this session, we will share the journey it took to get here, highlighting the incredible story of what has likely been the most collaborative API development process in Kubernetes history, with over 150 contributors and 20 implementations already. This API also represents a fundamental shift in how Kubernetes APIs are developed. Although this may be the first CRD-based Kubernetes API to graduate to GA, there are already others in progress. We’ll talk about what this means for the future of Kubernetes, and the ecosystem as a whole. Finally, we’ll give an overview of the API, describing how it can be used for load balancing, in-cluster routing, and service mesh configuration. You’ll learn what it means for CRDs to be considered GA, and when, why, and how you can migrate to Gateway API if you’re not already using it.",

Every day, we replace thousands of nodes to upgrade software, anticipate host retirements, or swiftly react to hardware failures. To automate node replacements, we use and extend the Eviction API and Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs). We will share our experience working with these primitives, discuss their limitations, describe solutions, and propose improvements. We will cover the following topics: - the case for default PDBs; - the abuse of the readiness probe; - the missing node lifecycle hooks; - recent, ongoing, and possible changes to the Eviction API and PDBs; - existing open source projects that can each play a role in the solution. After this talk, attendees will be better prepared to deal with node replacements, especially at scale, whether initiated by them or by a managed Kubernetes distribution.",

The vast majority of Kubernetes operators have at least one custom-resource API installed, and many clusters have dozens, or even hundreds. A whole ecosystem has sprung up around Kubernetes-hosted APIs. However, an API is much more than just the data schema, and to build a full featured Kubernetes-hosted API, users are often forced to deal with imperative and opaque extension mechanisms such as Webhooks. This makes API development and operations more difficult and error-prone than it needs to be. In fact, this is true for the built-in Kubernetes APIs as well as CRD APIs. In this talk, we will examine the work that has been done so far, and the work that is in progress to make defining APIs easier and more declarative, and the overall vision of declarative API definition.",

      "description": "Supply chain security is an increasingly important issue in cloud-native computing: the number of attacks has grown by over 300% since 2021. It is common for pipelines to build and push images to the cluster, but uncommon for those images to be removed from a node’s local store once a CVE has been disclosed. Kubernetes has no built-in solution to this problem: its garbage collection only responds to disk pressure. As images become outdated, they present a risk as users may run a vulnerable container. Eraser, a CNCF sandbox project, is an open source solution that automates the scanning and removal of images. What distinguishes Eraser is that it gives more control over removal: the developer decides what gets removed and when. By default, Eraser uses Trivy to scan images based on a given threshold of vulnerability. Images can also be removed based on custom logic. The talk will begin with a demo of Eraser in action, before showing an example of customizing the removal process.",

Although K8s is a widely accepted platform for running stateful workloads in containerized form, legacy big data workloads are struggling to transition to containerized K8s due to gaps in enterprise-ready big data management. In this talk, we will share how Cloudera is pioneering the path toward K8s from legacy Hadoop with open-source technologies around resource management and multi-tenancy architecture. Most big data applications are closely integrated stateful microservices, and migrating them to enterprise-hardened multi-tenant platform is challenging. We will showcase a case study that highlights challenges of managing noisy workloads in a shared multi-tenant K8s cluster at scale. Topics covered will include concurrency-based autoscaling, latencies in disaggregated storage from compute, and an effective hierarchical quota management solution for K8s.",

We begin by categorizing metrics according to different areas of etcd's code: etcdserver, storage, peers, and maintenance. We’ll look at the key concepts using architecture diagrams. Next, we’ll have a hands-on session that explores common etcd operations and the associated metrics. Finally, we will show what to expect during typical production incidents, such as disk/network issues and an overloaded etcd. We’ll use the etcd benchmark tool to stress local cluster and etcd proxy to insert network failures. The audience will learn how to set up production-ready etcd monitoring.

However, using such models come at a steep computational cost and is a major barrier to entry for many businesses and researchers. This talk proposes a novel approach to improve LLM efficiency, for complex reasoning tasks, by composing containerized LLMs as an inference decision tree called Tree Of Thoughts (ToT) and orchestrating it using various K8S ecosystem projects. ToT is an inference framework in combinatorial problem space, where each node represents a specific train of thought. This approach improves inference efficiency by refining prompts from the initial inputs through ‘conversations’ between models. All this sounds abstract, so using CNCF projects such as Operator Framework, Redis, Neo4j, and KEDA you will learn how to build a concrete ToT implementation. With real time visualization of graphs of intermediate LLM prompts and thoughts, you will see how ToT on Kubernetes enhances the computational efficiency of LLM inferencing.",

Workload owners are unaware of resource requirements from each other which may result into in-efficient resource utilization overall. The Compute Platform team solves the problem of efficient utilization of resources. Scale limit of the Kubernetes scheduler controls the size of a Kubernetes cluster, so we run workloads on a multi-cluster setup. Efficient utilization of resources becomes even more challenging due to the problems like fragmentation and hot-clusters in a multi-cluster setup. This session focuses on challenges and solutions of running batch workloads in a multi-cluster setup.

Now imagine quality control for an open-source multi-cloud runtime with hundreds of components that enterprises around the world rely upon. How you keep consistency and functional guarantees across APIs, features and components with contributions from the community. Which quality gates are needed? What is next? In this session, Yaron and Artur will delve into the quality assurance processes to guarantee multi-cloud consistency and stability in the Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr). You will learn how the Dapr maintainers have created a lifecycle for APIs, features and components to enter the Dapr binary and evolve into stable versions. You will also gain valuable insights into the certification procedures and guidelines that ensure functional quality and consistency in behavior for multi-cloud implementations of cloud-native building blocks.",

These vulnerabilities are identified using image scanners. However, the resulting long to-do list can overwhelm a team, leaving CVEs that matter unattended for long periods of time. You will come away from this session with new and better practices for prioritizing vulnerability patching. The key being consideration of the actual impact of the identified vulnerabilities on your security posture. The solution leverages eBPF technology to identify and highlight vulnerabilities in running artifacts and libraries. The resulting filtered Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) enables users to automatically detect vulnerabilities whose patching will have an immediate and significant impact on the security posture.",

It can protect the kernel from malicious actors executing in containers and it also limits what an attacker can do within the container. Despite the support Kubernetes has for Seccomp profiles, the adoption is very low. Have high adoption would raise the security level considerably._________________________________CNCF STAG (Security Technical Advisory Group) leads will be available to answer your cloud native security questions.

We will show how Numaproj creates automatic embedding in VectorDB to effectively use GenAI to interpret real-time insights. With real-time insights, MTTD came down from 30 minutes to 3 minutes, and to reduce MTTR, we used prompt engineering and tuning to close the last mile through an interactive experience.

We will deep dive into changes we upstreamed to the Linux kernel and then brought to Cilium such as the new veth-replacement driver. We also take a look at new features like BIG TCP which so far have not been brought into the wider Kubernetes community. This talk is for operators that want to get the most out of their setup. While many start with the default settings for getting started on “day 1”, “day 2” challenges will often lead to seeking ways to turn the performance knob up.

      "description": "Logging refers to recording events generated by our applications or systems, and its purpose is to provide us with an understanding of what's happening within the software. When an event is generated, either structured or unstructured, it's delivered to a central place for analysis, usually to the file system or third-party service over the network by using some transport layer that encapsulates the message into Syslog, Forward, OpenTelemetry, or another format. If these events come from different sources and in different formats, at scale present complex challenges, so how can we deal with this heterogeneous nature and make sure we can have a suitable logging layer in our infrastructure? In this presentation, we will do a deep dive into how application logging works around formats, transport, and aggregation. We will share best practices to deal with multiline messages, redaction, and implement a scalable logging layer by using industry standards with Fluent Bit and OpenTelemetry.",

Kubernetes is also evolving these APIs using the Gateway API project, solving some of the shortcoming of existing core APIs to represent and expose all the new features of modern load balancers. Load balancers can provide different benefits to applications: service discovery, fault tolerance, better performance, cost reduction, zero downtime rolling updates, ... but this does not depend only of the loadbalancer itself, it requires a perfect coordination between all elements involved, from the application, to the network topology, deployment models, autoscaling algorithm, load balancer type, traffic characteristics, cost budget, ... During this session Antonio and Gerrit will share best practices on how to use network load balancers in Kubernetes and how to avoid the most common mistakes.",

As more applications begin to utilize eBPF, the lack of cooperation, wide use of critical permissions and zero cluster-wide visibility can lead to a “perfect storm” of issues which are almost impossible to diagnose. In this talk we’ll discuss our journey to achieve a better standard for deploying and managing the lifecycle of eBPF programs on Kubernetes. We will demonstrate how bpfd, a system daemon and Kubernetes operator for managing eBPF programs, can be used to deploy, observe and secure those programs on all your cluster nodes. Attendees will see how things can go wrong when multiple networking programs are contending for the same resources and learn how bpfd can be used to diagnose and fix these types of issues.",

With Azure as our chosen cloud provider, AKS naturally became the logical option for our Kubernetes infrastructure. Considering the presence of multiple developer teams at the company, it was clear that individual investigations into the Kubernetes setup would be inefficient. In response, we initiated a project to develop a unified Kubernetes platform for all our developer teams. The initial building phase involved a group of consultants utilizing Infrastructure as Code (IAC). After a few months, the project was transitioned to an internal team, leading to a significant evolution of both the Kubernetes platform and the associated platform engineering team.

How do we grant access in a timely and time-bound manner? How do we think about what permissions need what level of scrutiny?

Software supply chain, privileged user compromise or other attacks can compromise individual microservices in a trusted domain. Compromised microservices, malicious insiders or software errors can cause spurious calls to microservices. They can impersonate users in such calls and modify or augment parameters of such calls. Transaction Tokens (TraTs) is a new proposal in the IETF OAuth working group. TraTs complement existing security protocols such as SPIFFE and assure user identity and context information in a call chain. TraTs allow nesting, enabling intermediate services to assert that they have processed a call to downstream services in a call chain. In this talk we will explain TraTs with examples and use cases, and show how they can help defend against a number of attacks in microservice architectures.",

Projects like multus can insert multiple network interface to pod, problems such as routing tuning and IP allocation among multiple network interfaces cannot be solved. There is no IPAM projects in the community to support complicated requirements of underlay IPAM, such as IP dual-stack support, fixed IP for application, IP recycling, IP conflicts, etc..

Depending on how you select the nodes in your cluster, you could be in such a situation today - without even knowing it! The cause is one of the biggest “hidden” costs of using Kubernetes: system overhead. Overhead is the portion of every node that is designated unusable and is reserved for Kubernetes to provide its services to you. While overhead cannot be entirely eliminated, Alex and Michael will present their work exploring how to minimize this performance-robbing property of Kubernetes. They will present a study of overheads across the major providers’ node families, demo new overhead measurement features available in Opencost (a CNCF Sandbox project), and provide an analysis of the results. This talk will also include a brief overview of actionable recommendations and novel methodologies for sizing Kubernetes clusters.",

From a monolithic application with two database engines our microservice architecture grew to over 40 microservices, multiple databases, and queue engines. Running the entire application on our developers’ laptops was no longer feasible while building and pushing images made for a slow, frustrating developer experience. Exploring different tools, we found the CNCF-hosted sandbox project Telepresence and ‘remocal’ (hybrid) development environment to be the most useful: all our services run in multi-tenant developer clusters while the services we’re developing run locally with our debugging IDEs and tools. This gave us a much faster feedback loop with more realistic results. We’ve also integrated Telepresence commands into our custom VFCLI. In this case study, we’ll explain how Telepresence sped up how our engineering team develops and debug microservices plus the benefits of implementing a remocal dev environment.",

However, detecting sensitive data patterns, like social security or credit card numbers in encrypted L7 network traffic has traditionally been done in user space. By leveraging in-kernel HTTP visibility and kTLS, we now have the ability to paint a complete security picture and monitor sensitive data flows between Kubernetes workloads, even if they are encrypted. Using Tetragon, this talk will demonstrate how eBPF can be applied to solve the technical challenge of decrypting TLS traffic by using kTLS and showcase how Security Teams can detect sensitive data patterns, like social security numbers or exploit signatures in encrypted L7 traffic. By using eBPF, this solution avoids operational complexity, overhead, and is fully transparent to the application as well as the CNI.",

One of the largest barriers to entry is FedRAMP accreditation, a standard which is both challenging to meet and expensive to maintain. In 2019, Palantir became FedRAMP accredited using a pre-Kubernetes tech stack and faced many challenges maintaining the environment efficiently. CNCF technologies provide a compelling solution, and as a result, Palantir has modernized its infrastructure using Kubernetes and other CNCF projects to streamline compliance and greatly reduce the support burden. Ali will provide an overview of FedRAMP, focusing on technical compliance requirements, and share Palantir's journey to modernization. She'll discuss how Palantir leverages cloud native technologies to meet these requirements, including FIPS encryption and continuous deployment, far more easily - and how others can do the same.",

We achieve this by using modern k8s extension features to guide the scheduler using a non-linear hardware model of power as a function of utilization and a measurement of the current utilization of node components. In addition, we apply power limits to components on the system which are underutilized based on a model of the power requirements for the running jobs.

For Admin streaming, main thread becomes bottlenecked due to the accumulation of TraceWrappers from the worker threads. Consequently, XDS updates may experience throttling. Therefore, this solution is unsuitable for high traffic rates. The implementation for streaming Grpc Sink for transport socket level tapping aims to resolve these problems and to provide a set of counters representing the traced traffic and to provide ConnectionInfo cache replay mechanism. Take it a step further, given tapping filter can be a memory copy intensive scenario for CPU, we introduce memory copy lib to offload the work to hardware accelerator for memory copy.",

Even a single controller contains a diverse range of configuration parameters that introduces the opportunities for mistakes, and moreover multiple controllers can interact badly with each other and with environmental events due to shared dependencies. For example, pods can fail to be created even though resources are enough, or can oscillate in an unending cycle of scheduling and eviction. This talk first presents a collection of pathological and unintended issues arising from controllers. Then it discusses Kivi, a prototype project that verifies correctness of Kubernetes clusters to help users detect issues before they apply changes.

      "description": "eBPF is a great tool for network traffic management and observation in a service cluster. However, the current tooling to deploy eBPF programs and agents often requires its own VM or containers in a k8s cluster, and this heavy infrastructure defeats the lightweight benefits of eBPF. Wasm, on the other hand, has become a lightweight alternative “container” for the k8s ecosystem. It is now possible to create Wasm-based eBPF control plane applications that manage eBPF agents in k8s pods. In this talk, we will discuss the eBPF plugin from the WasmEdge community (a CNCF sandbox project). It allows lightweight WasmEdge sandboxes managed by container tools such as containerd, crun, Docker, and Podman, to deploy and control eBPF applications in k8s clusters. We will discuss the mechanism that enables the eBPF plugin in WasmEdge, as well as developer APIs and tools for building eBPF applications.",

In game development, the applications of GenAI are boundless: creating art assets, auto-generating game code, life-like conversations with bots, and generating levels from player input. While most users are willing to wait seconds for inference, game developers need sub-second latency to ensure a good player experience. GenAI during gameplay brings demanding requirements - low latency, high performance, fast scalability, and low cost. Therefore, solving this use case will benefit the entire Kubernetes ecosystem. In this talk, we will present an in-depth analysis of deployment options for GenAI inference alongside applications running on Kubernetes. We will also demonstrate real-time GenAI inference integrated with distributed game servers running on Kubernetes using OSS Agones.",

We will explore potential areas for improvement: for instance, transforming from N hollow nodes to a single central controller while maintaining a memory footprint under 100MB, thus making it possible to conduct a 5k node/50k pod test on a laptop. We will then illustrate the utilization of KWOK for YuniKorn's scalability testing. Given KWOK's low resource demands, we will demonstrate its seamless integration into popular CI pipelines such as Github Actions. This allows early detection of performance degradation within the development workflow. Our discourse aims to elucidate a path toward more efficient and effective Kubernetes scalability testing and set the stage for innovative developments in the field.",

Under the hood there are several components that Kubernetes relies on: Kubelet, Runtimes, Monitoring Agents, the OS kernel and hardware. This presentation will touch on UX changes for end users, interfaces between k8s stack components and how different pluggable algorithms, implemented via code and new policies, can help achieve evolved performance, power and resource utilization goals.",

These are qualities we look for when establishing our infrastructure to support Kubernetes and even building the workloads we run atop. However, Nix certainly has its trade-offs. For one, the function-style language (nix) may feel foreign to many in the Go-dominated, cloud-native, ecosystem. Additionally, Nix has unconventional opinions around packages themselves, along with host details, such as the existence of /bin, /lib, etc. Today, we will explore the potential relationship between the Kubernetes ecosystem and Nix. Does it elegantly solve real problems or is the added complexity a non-starter?",

Although its native functionality allows complex tasks to be run in a direct acyclic graph, its tasks are represented in a new pod which is a bottleneck for constructing network and environment in order to run the task inside the new pod. This is not suitable for production ML Pipelines and Middleware, where tasks and components need to be performed quickly and often require network capabilities beyond a single pod. To address this, we collaborated with the Tekton community to develop custom tasks that are not limited by the single pod environment, enabling us to handle advanced ML scenarios such as data passing, network communication, and resource distribution more efficiently in a Kubernetes-native way. Additionally, we integrated Tekton into KubeFlow Pipelines, an ML orchestration platform, to eliminate storage bottlenecks in Kubernetes and make our ML pipelines truly scalable.",

Ford is a long time Kubernetes user and in this talk we are going to show how two recent features are allowing developers and platform engineers to manage API tokens effectively and securely. Those features are Service Account Token Volume projection (that brings some new security features compared to the default Service Account Tokens) and Workload Identity Federation (that allows linking Kubernetes Service Accounts with third party services).",
