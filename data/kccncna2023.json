      "description": "CRI-O recently graduated within the CNCF ecosystem! Thatâ€™s not only a huge milestone for the users of the project, but also for its maintainers. Having a stable and pluggable container runtime alternative available for Kubernetes provides end users more freedom of choice, generally drives innovation and avoids ending-up in silo projects which own all the knowledge of a technical domain. Join this session to learn more about the CNCFâ€™s newest graduated container runtime! We discuss how the latest architecture looks, what the graduation process looked like for us, and how recent enhancements like verifying sigstore signatures work under the hood. The CRI-O maintainers will take you through a tour of recent features and usability improvements to shape the big picture of what they plan for the future of the project.",
