      "description": "\n  Why Attend NSMCon? Are you running workloads in multiple clusters? Across multiple clouds: on-premises, hybrid, multicloud, or public cloud? Do they need to interact with legacy workloads running in less “cloudy” environments? Network Service Mesh (NSM) ties them all together, at the granularity of individual workloads, not cluster/VPCs/data centers. NSM is a community-driven, CNCF Sandbox project that is rapidly gaining momentum because of its ability to simplify connectivity between workloads, independent of where they are running. It extends an IP reachability domain to workloads running in multiple clusters, legacy environments, on-premises, or in a public cloud, communicating with the protocols they are currently using.NSM does this at the granularity of individual workloads. Your workloads have connectivity to just the workloads they need…nothing more, nothing less. NSM brings the useful features of a Service Mesh from the lofty heights of HTTP all the way down to IP itself. Applications and Application Service Meshes, such as Istio, run unaltered on top, leaving the hybrid/multicloud IP connectivity to NSM.The project emerged organically as a community project to solve these problems by applying the Service Mesh thought process all the way down to IP with the global peering mentality of the Internet itself – without breaking your existing environment.Join the people building and using NSM at NSMCon for a day of tutorials, deep dives, and use cases to learn how NSM works, what it can do for you, and, most importantly, what’s coming next.

It allows developers to create applications such that when a dataset is changed, the watcher for that dataset on another system receives the notification and performs user-specified action. A simple use case is a user has a program using etcd watchers to monitor the stock market and sell (user-defined action) if their stock of interest falls below price $X.  There are error failures that are not automatically covered with an etcd cluster such as network connectivity issues, DC outage, and cloud infrastructure maintenance. The talk consists of the following: - what watchers are - how to build your services using heartbeat key for monitoring etcd watchers - perform locking on watchers to prevent race conditions - caching data locally for your service to keep running until the etcd cluster is back up.\n",

As end-users are mainly managing apps, it's time for kubernetes to get a representation and a definition of it.  The sig-apps community came to an agreement to provide this missing piece.

We break a Cloud Native architecture into a small portion of design pattern per context to make it reusable and composable. As this approach enables sharing a well designed and maintained integration pattern across organizations, our software delivery becomes safe and scalable.We will throw a live demo to build an application from some practical design patterns to turn it to Cloud Native application and delivery it to production safely.We leverage Tekton, Cuelang, and many other Open Source tools, and we will give all participants our insight to use those tools to achieve such scalable application delivery\n",

Gopay processes transactions worth billions of dollars, with peak scale of more than 15000 financial transactions per minute. Gopay has heavily adopted Kubernetes to run its few hundred microservices and has very recently migrated to a service mesh based architecture.This talk is a case study of why Gopay chose to move to service mesh, and how it was accomplished with zero downtime. Mahendra will cover some of the critical decisions made by the team, the overall approach for migration, along with a few interesting war stories. He will also discuss the criticality of monitoring the health of service mesh and how the team is doing it using Prometheus and Cortex.\n",

      "description": "\n  One of the most pressing security problems in cloud native is the secure delivery of container images. Common solutions addressing this problem live under the assumption that a signing key, used to protect an artifact or its distribution, is kept safe. But time has shown again and again that this assumption is faulty, and that a single key loss or compromise can cause enormous damage. That is why The Update Framework (TUF) was designed not only to prevent and detect attacks, but also with risk mitigation (reducing the damage from a successful attack) as a core principle. Being the first security-focused project to graduate in the CNCF, TUF is widely used both in and outside of the cloud ecosystem. In this talk we will describe the basic architecture of TUF including how TUF protects against a variety of real-world attacks on any software distribution infrastructure. We will show how even if an organization makes a security error (a server is hacked, a private key is checked into github, etc.), TUF can bring a repository back into a secure state.\n",

Therefore, network service providers, like ISPs and Telco operators, are at the point of looking for a way to adopt the new cloud-native paradigm for their sophisticated network demands. Network Service Mesh is a CNCF project that offers a potential solution. In this talk we are going to introduce the approach Network Service Mesh is using to solve complicated L2/L3 challenges in Kubernetes and provide an example of building real cloud-native network topology using the tools provided by the NSM project.

      "description": "\n  Pulling image is one of the time-consuming steps in the container startup process. The most critical factor is the current OCI Image Spec with which a container cannot be started until its all image layers are downloaded. However, most of the contents in image layers are not being used for real-world workloads.In this talk, Kohei will show state-of-the-art alternative image formats which lead to faster container startup by allowing container runtimes to start a container without waiting for all its contents to be locally available. He will also introduce CNCF containerd's fast image distribution approach \"Remote Snapshotter\" which leverages these formats (https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/3731). Finally, he will share the status of his current work on the remote snapshotter implementation and how to take advantage of the new functionality.\n",

      "description": "\n  As security practices and tools for scanning container images are becoming increasingly popular, malicious actors are introducing sophisticated techniques to obfuscate their intent and evade scanning tools. The malware they plant cannot be detected using static analysis, or based on signatures. But dynamic analysis that runs the image, and then traces the activity of the running container can detect and document the entire multi-stage attack.In this talk, we will review the evolution of these attacks as observed by Aqua’s security research team, and demonstrate the full chain of events and IoCs (indicators if compromise) that were detected. We will give practical advice on what developers and cluster admins should do to detect similar techniques, and the security controls the should be employed to reduce the chances of such an attack succeeding, as well as reduce its potential impact.\n",

      "description": "\n  Kubernetes and FaaS have solved most of the challenges of dealing with stateless applications. But when it comes to handling state, it quickly becomes “someone else's problem”. Because of that, we have struggled with the same issues of data consistency and complex failure semantics for the past decade. For stateful applications, we are still far from the smooth development and operations experience associated with serverless.Stateful Functions is a new pattern to solve this problem. It uses containerized, event-driven functions with a stream processor (Apache Flink), not a database, to manage the state and handle the messaging between functions. This talk walks through the ideas behind Stateful Functions and shows how this simple framework solves the problem of consistency and failure semantics within and across functions, at the same time staying true to the serverless experience.\n",

Currently they are addressed using approaches like Multus, Danm, CNI-Genie. All this still only works on a node level but will require a substantial amount of complex case specific, on-site DevOps to bottom-up build a functional multi-network cluster, with all challenges that come with that, like LCM.This seminar will cover how Network Service Mesh (NSM) can address networking challenges of cloud native telco applications in 5G with the details of proof of concept and how NSM decouple infrastructure from applications. The speakers will also give details of the ongoing work with CNF test bed network separation use case.\n",

All-in-all there are fifteen components that provide all the platform features and services, so we had to get creative to make sure that we kept up to date with all of them.In this talk we will share our solutions for setting up a platform delivery pipeline and the lifecycle management of our platform components.

The concept is quite appealing at first sight. But different implementations and lack of agreement, both on the client applications and on the Authorization Servers, can ruin your trip.In this talk we will explain the basic concepts of OIDC, how it works, how it compares to other Federated Authentication systems like SAML, and some integration examples like Harbor or Kubernetes. Then we talk about some common issues that are still rough edges, like the user onboarding and the roles and group management. Finally, we will see how we can make some non-OIDC aware applications work with OIDC by delegating authentication to an Nginx proxy.\n",

We'll then go further by showing how we used WASM to move functionality typically reserved for the edge of our deployments - API Gateway functions like token validation, rate limiting, and payload transformation - into the service mesh in a real user's deployment.\n",

In this session, Stefan and Hidde will talk about implementing these techniques on Kubernetes. We will discuss in depth how canary releases can be orchestrated through Git operations, declaratively, using Kubernetes custom resources and Flux git-to-cluster synchronization. We will demo a GitOps pipeline that automates the release process of a web application. The demo will feature: - Flux for cluster state management - Flux Helm Operator for app deployments - Flagger for app testing and incremental rollout\n",

Distributed tracing provides the ability to drill down deeper into an issue when triaging an alert with a non-obvious root cause. It’s already difficult to jump from metrics raising an alert to a representative problematic trace, but even once there, users often want to compare a problematic trace with a non-problematic one to help root cause the issue. This talk demonstrates how to jump straight from an alert notification to displaying a problematic trace along with a comparison to a non-problematic trace.This is accomplished with a combination of open source tools such as Prometheus, Jaeger, Grafana and M3. The audience will learn how recent advances in the community can enable them to reduce their time-to-mitigation by providing the relevant context of a bad request vs a good request directly from a graph.\n",

It wasn’t easy to build an architecture able to handle this load, and we’ve had our share of problems along the way.This talk starts with a presentation of how Kubernetes DNS works. It then dives into the challenges we’ve faced, which span a variety of topics related to load, connection tracking, upstream servers, rolling updates, resolver implementations, and performance. We then show how our DNS architecture evolved over time to address or mitigate these problems. Finally, we share our solutions for detecting these problems before they happen—and identifying misbehaving clients.\n",

This is time-consuming.This talk demonstrates how to automatically handle vulnerabilities detected by a scanner using OPA.- The vulnerabilities found by a scanner in CI are handled automatically by Open Policy Agent- Applying custom policy, OPA shows users which vulnerabilities to addressThis automatic vulnerability handling in CI will be demonstrated live, along with Trivy, which is an open source vulnerability scanner for containers.

This model uses Envoy based ingress/egress gateways per-tenant, which helps:- set traffic policies and scale resources per-tenant- hide tenant application topology when communicating with external entities- assign per-tenant identities (SPIFFE) for use with transport authentication (mTLS), authorization (OAuth2) \u0026 origin authentication (JWT)- share mesh control plane resources across tenants\n",

It can reliably ingest and query millions of time series per second with sub-second latency. The current storage design uses a NoSQL store to index series and an object store for compressed time series data - two dependencies, and one with significant cost implications. In this talk we will show the new experimental Cortex blocks storage, based on Thanos and Prometheus TSDB, aiming to reduce the Cortex operational cost without compromising scalability and performances. We’ll cover the trade-off between the standard chunks storage and the new blocks storage, and share lessons learned running Cortex at scale. Cortex is a CNCF sandbox project.\n",

Such isolation and security needs to be implemented in a way that consumes as little host resources as possible, while being immune to potentially malicious host root user. Additionally, the preferred implementation needs to be compatible with a high-performance (offloaded) K8s CNI. This presentation provides an overview of such an implementation for Software Defined (SDN) K8s node networking, based on Open Virtual Network (OVN) and Open vSwitch (OVS)) and offloaded to “bump-in-the-wire” Smart NICs .\n",

The use cases involved are focused on backend engineers and DevOps. But what about us front-end engineers? Often, we get blamed first when something breaks and the lack of consistent observability tools makes it difficult to debug issues.With the emergence of OpenTelemetry for JavaScript, more front-end developers are looking to instrument their code and connect their traces with the backend. A growing number of teams are adopting GraphQL as their interface between UI and backend as well. This talk will illustrate the process of setting up your app for tracing with OpenTelemetry, show what’s common in GraphQL instrumentation compared to other libraries and describe the potential pitfalls of the approach. Building on that, we will discuss how tracing affects user experience.\n",

Just as many organizations support open source by hiring developers, paying bug bounties directly supports security researchers. The Kubernetes BBP is particularly interesting as it’s still rare for a large scale, open-source infrastructure project to have a public BBP.In this talk, we’ll cover what a BBP is and what it means for Kubernetes. We’ll cover vendor selection for the bug bounty, defining the scope and rewards, learnings from the private beta, and what you need to know as a researcher and user today. We’ll also reiterate how the Product Security Committee responds to new vulnerabilities, so you know what’s being done to keep clusters safe.\n",

In this session we will dive into the Distributed Application Runtime, Dapr, an open source, vendor neutral project that has gained community attention as it enables developers to combine highly portable, stateless functions and stateful actors using any language or developer framework of their choice. With built in state management, distributed tracing based on Open Telemetry and pub/sub based on Cloud Events you can take advantage of Dapr to build highly available serverless applications that run on any cloud.\n",

Finding ideal initial values requires deep technical expertise. Workloads change over time, requiring regular effort to re-tune stale parameters. As a consequence, configuration errors have become a source of operational toil and one of the major causes of system failures across the industry. The service mesh should aim to expose a minimal configuration surface by dynamically adjusting parameters based on observations.Tony Allen will provide a deep-dive into how Envoy’s Adaptive Concurrency Control feature dynamically tunes circuit breaker thresholds using real-time sampling of request latencies, removing the need for periodic adjustment. He will also discuss lessons learned deploying the feature to Lyft’s production service mesh.\n",

They became quite slow at scale, and had limitations preventing them from growing beyond approximately 5,000 endpoints per Service.In this talk, Rob will show how the scalability of network endpoints has been dramatically increased in Kubernetes. He’ll cover the design and implementation of EndpointSlices, along with the impact they’ve had. He’ll walk through the process of profiling key components in the Kubernetes codebase to identify areas that could be optimized. Finally, he’ll show how all this work has improved Kubernetes network scalability, including real world performance metrics from large clusters with over 100,000 endpoints.\n",

His Freshman album, This Is Life, highlights the talents of his writing ability, the moral message of his music, and the production talents of both himself and James Waddell. When he’s not writing and performing his own original music, Hicks is on the road touring the world with Blues icon, Keb’ Mo. International touring has lent him years of maturity that most young artists never get to experience. This interesting blend of influences and experiences have made him “the” artist to watch in Nashville.\n",

      "description": "\n  Working in security can be intimidating and the shortage of people in the space makes hiring difficult. But especially in cloud native environments, security is something everyone must own. If you’ve ever asked yourself, “what does it take to work in security in a cloud native environment? How can you move into security from a dev or an ops position? Where should you start and what should you learn about?” then this talk is for you.Justin Cormack, Security Lead at Docker and member of CNCF SIG Security will share his personal experience gradually moving from ops to dev to security, the reasons for his transitions, and what he learned along the way. He will break down why security really is one of the most interesting and different areas to specialize in and why working in security might be for you.\n",

The talk considers the motivations for building a system capable of ingesting metrics from thousands of clusters, including: multi-cluster monitoring and cluster telemetry. Lucas discusses how Thanos Receive is able to satisfy these requirements and how its hash ring design allows it to scale and maintain ingestion availability even during upgrades.

Whatever the application, goals are always the same: making sure our pods are able to scale-up quickly enough so users don't ever face any latency nor HTTP/5xx, while keeping the cost as low as possible. As both goals directly leverage the other, the complexity is all about finding the correct balance. Instead of putting the regular 80% CPU utilization threshold (which is sometimes fine-tuned with load-testing and/or feedback monitoring), would it be possible to have a more mathematical approach to solve this problem?During this talk Antoine will present one he created and explain how to utilize it within Kubernetes.\n",

The EU/EFPIA IMI2 Joint Undertaking funded “MELLODDY” (Machine Learning Ledger Orchestration for Drug Discovery, Grant n° 831472) initiative, a 3 year 18.4M EUR effort, brings together 10 leading pharma companies and 7 tech partners to build a new collaborative ML platform that boosts drug discovery model development while addressing both security and privacy preservation concerns (including commercial confidentiality). Kubernetes provides the consistent computing infrastructure across companies ensuring that data owners maintain control while running the common ML software and sharing the resulting models.

They will present common container workload securing practices and demonstrate how the container runtime will apply those to the target system. The talk will cover best practices in SELinux, AppArmor, seccomp, Linux capabilities and namespace isolation techniques which make Kubernetes based end-user applications more secure. At the end of the talk, they will also cover a general overview of the current status of container runtime security.\n",

Regardless of the chosen solution, compromises need to be made and eventually, failures will occur.In this session David and Stephan will show their real world setup of reasonably large clusters (up to 150 nodes currently), the reasoning behind the network design and the failure stories they experienced and had to deal with. The topics are ranging from ingress controllers via BGP, network routing, DNS and iptables to hardware load balancer appliances - and how those technologies are not as cloud native as one might wish.\n",

While working on the Cloud Native Application Bundle (CNAB) project, we built tooling to package whole applications as OCI Images so that they could be pushed to and pulled from registries. We learnt a lot doing this and would like to share with the community.   During this talk, we will have a quick but in-depth view of: * The OCI Image specification and its future * How to push a multi service application to a registry * Our battle scars with the different interpretations of the OCI spec by the mainstream registries\n",

The new tooling from CNB is capable of building smaller resultant images by separating the build layers from the runtime layers. In order to increase the speed and efficiency of GitLab's products, the Product team investigated the Cloud Native Buildpacks, which provide a cloud-native means of standardizing code detection and producing a standards-based container runtime.

Often, an entire division of recruiting/HR is dedicated to sourcing these individuals. There’s just one problem: They don't actually know what to do next.

In a demo, we will deploy a member of the federation which will then receive workloads to analyze subatomic collision data.\n",

      "description": "\n  Virtualization must be lightweight to be useful for improving the isolation of container runtimes (e.g., Kata containers): adding traditional (heavyweight) virtualization layers to container primitives would, for example, result in unacceptable boot time and performance for important use cases like serverless computing. Fortunately, the community has made great strides towards lightweight virtualization with new VM monitors (e.g., AWS Firecracker) and associated tooling (e.g., Weaveworks Ignite). However, there has been relatively little attention paid to the guest kernel itself, which remains unnecessarily bloated, affecting both performance and security. We will make the case for guest kernel specialization via kernel configuration and highlight key challenges in applying these techniques in a sandboxed container context.\n",

Also, Vitess's built-in support for resharding workflows makes migrating from existing databases into databases resident in multiple locations easy.In this talk the speakers will show how to build a custom sharding scheme in Vitess that respects data locality requirements. They will then demonstrate a database cluster built using this scheme that enables transfer of existing data belonging to people from 8 different countries from one jurisdiction to four(4) separate jurisdictions with zero downtime at the application level.\n",

Data centres alone consume 3% of the world's energy, and more and more of that energy is being used by Kubernetes and workloads running on Kubernetes. Is k8s helping, or making things worse?The beauty of the cloud is that it makes it easy to run code, virtualised and scheduled for efficiency... but it doesn't provide any guarantee that what's running is useful. Even when the workload is high-value and efficient, Kube sprawl can lead to low utilisation, unsatisfactory elasticity, and high costs - but mega-mono-clusters have their own problems around isolation, security, and management. How should these competing requirements be balanced? This talk discusses some of the trade-offs and provides a roadmap to figuring out the right thing.\n",

There are multiple strategies for doing an upgrade, but they all require rescheduling workloads and restarting cluster components.We started offering upgrades on our managed Kubernetes platform, DigitalOcean Kubernetes Service (DOKS), in May 2019. Since then, our customers have kicked off about 20,000 automated patch and minor release upgrades on their clusters. Most of those upgrades went well, but some didn't and we've learned a few things from the ones that went wrong.In this talk we will share lessons from a year of automated Kubernetes upgrades: what we got right, what we got wrong, workloads that caused us trouble, and changes we've made to make the process smoother. We hope these lessons will help others avoid pain in their Kubernetes upgrades.\n",

      "description": "\n  Conventional, the concept of Kubernetes multi-tenancy is realized by namespaces. Tenants access controls are limited within tenant namespaces using RBAC rules. The Pod level isolation is primarily done using network policy.This model faces various problems when applied in production since Kubernetes is far from tenancy-ready. For example:1) APIServer is lack of tenant-aware flow control. A single tenant may generate large amount of concurrent traffic making APIServer unresponsive to other tenants;2) Tenants cannot install customized CRDs which requires cluster scope permission;We proposed Virtual Cluster solution to resolve the multi-tenancy problem from a different angle. Basically, every tenant will be assigned a dedicated K8s control plane. All tenant K8s shares a big super master. Virtual cluster is built based on CRDs. The entire solution is open sourced in Github.\n",

The best published results for performance sensitive machine learning workloads, e.g. MLPerf v0.6, were obtained by reading the datasets from local SSDs. While the MLPerf datasets fit comfortably on a single SSD, it’s a luxury not afforded to folks training models against petabyte scale datasets. We’ll share our experience running MLPerf training jobs in Kubernetes, against datasets stored by Kubernetes stateful storage services orchestrated by Rook. Highlights include the performance and scalability tradeoffs associated with local and open source distributed storage, and how machine learning formats like RecordIO and TFRecord provide performance utility and model validation flexibility.\n",

While this is notably high, mental health is further exacerbated by stress, a condition nearly all professionals in technology grapple with. Attendees are encouraged to view one of Jennifer’s 2019 Kubecon talks prior to attending “Stress and Mental Health in Technology.” In her follow-up, time will be dedicated to the impact of stress on productivity and effectiveness, and will include ways in which its aversive effects can be managed. Why are so many professionals in tech burning out? Why are so many diagnosed with mental health conditions? Why is working in technology so stressful? Why is stress minimized and accepted as part of the job? Why aren't we giving this more attention considering the impact work-related stress has on nearly every area of our lives, including overall functioning, health and well-being?

However, testing cluster features in an isolated fashion has been traditionally fairly difficult. Infra teams such as HDFS, YARN, and Azkaban often step on top of one another for testing new features in our existing test Hadoop clusters. Setting up a new test cluster requires coordination between hardware, infra, and security teams, usually taking weeks to months. We have recently extended Kubernetes’ usage to test Hadoop(HDFS/YARN) clusters, by deploying production-like Hadoop cluster on Kubernetes. This has reduced infra setup time from weeks down to minutes with no network, hardware dependencies, and enables critical infra/workflow teams to test new features on the fly.\n",

      "description": "\n  Kubernetes admission controllers are plugins that govern and enforce how the cluster is used. They can be built-in to the APIServer, or webhooks that are customizable to your needs. Admission webhooks help you do some really cool stuff, there are two kinds of webhooks, validating and mutating. In this talk we will go thorough the taxonomy of Admission Controllers, providing examples of each type, and how to use them. There are many built-in to kubernetes, and they are optional to use. Others are webhooks that can be run external to the cluster. We will detail the differences between mutating and validating webhooks, and when to use each. During our talk we will examine the difficulties and complications and propose resolutions. We will show code examples to help write your own in the future. Join us on a journey through existing Admission Controllers before you write your own!\n",

Even when models work perfectly, they can be attacked and/or degrade quickly if the data changes. Having a well understood MLOps process is necessary for ML security!Using Kubeflow, we will demonstrate how to the common ways machine learning workflows go wrong, and how to mitigate them using MLOps pipelines to provide reproducibility, validation, versioning/tracking, and safe/compliant deployment. We will also talk about the direction for MLOps as an industry, and how we can use it to move faster, with less risk, than ever before.\n",

Namespaces are one of the most important foundations of multi-tenancy in Kubernetes. In this talk, we introduce a new building block called Hierarchical Namespaces that allow policies like RBAC and Network Policies to be consistently inherited across trees of namespaces. Based on our experience working with customers, we believe this new technique will simplify namespace management in Enterprise and SaaS use cases. This talk will show how you can use hierarchical namespaces to safely and easily share your cluster across teams and deployments within an organization. Hierarchical Namespaces are an open source project currently incubating in the Multi-tenancy working group. You can check out the code and get involved in the project here: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/multi-tenancy/tree/master/incubator/hnc\n",

You will walk away with a deep technical knowledge of Prow and how we were able to implement internally so you can too.We’ll see how to correctly setup and deploy Prow on a Kubernetes instance. How to link it to a bot account. How to hook Prow to GitHub organizations and repositories, how to establish an automated governance process for the Open Source by configuring multiple Prow plugins.Finally the audience will learn how to create its own custom plugins in order to lint commit messages and code.\n",

      "description": "\n  While using Kubernetes, the need to automate our work is everpresent. Usually, the task boils to a simple pattern: subscribe to Kubernetes resource changes and acting upon them. In the simplest case, a ConfigMap creation will suffice. In the complex one, interaction with a Custom Resource might be required.Most of the operations engineers know a scripting language (e.g., bash) and are familiar with the jq tool, which employs an indigenous paradigm of traversing JSON structures inspired by the functional programming paradigm.A general-purpose programming language, without a doubt, provides tons of benefits, but do they not create a steep learning curve on the path to automating and extending Kubernetes?This talk focuses on writing simple operators with the shell-operator, using a scripting language (bash) and jq, and justifies such an approach.\n",

Even though large parts of CERN’s computing infrastructure are deployed using Kubernetes, physics analysis jobs are still being run on classical high throughput computing batch systems. While developing a fully cloud native computing approach, one still needs to have access to the ten-thousands of cores available on the legacy batch system to have sufficient resources for the data processing.In this presentation, Clemens will demonstrate how complex physics analysis workflows that are written and scheduled using Kubernetes can make use of classical batch systems. The audience will also learn what complexity a realistic physics analysis can reach, and the important role that software containers and Kubernetes play in the context of open science.\n",

      "description": "\n  These days, the most common reason for a Prometheus server to run out of memory is an excessive amount of time series in the so called head block, the part of the internal TSDB with the freshest data, which has to be kept in memory prior to consolidation into a block on disk. A large head block leads to a long restart time because the head block has to be rebuilt from the write-ahead log. On large servers, the restart time can be 10 minutes or more. Since restarts happen regularly to upgrade the binary or to change flags, the resulting interruption of sample collection is problematic. Even worse: After an OOM crash, the same replaying from the WAL has to happen, often causing another OOM crash immediately. Ganesh Vernekar will talk about the work started in late 2019 to persist parts of the head block earlier, thereby reducing both the memory footprint and the restart time.\n",

Nowadays NPD has already been well accepted and widely used in production environments.Actually identifying the problem is only the first step. What we need to do next is to handle those problems and rescue the nodes.In this talk, we will list common problems and share how we establish rules to decide whether a node is ready or not and how to fix them if recoverable. Moreover, we will introduce some use scenarios on how we make a 99.9% uptime guarantee with ten thousand nodes in a single cluster.

Although the technology has been in use for many years, it has not always kept pace with recent developments within the cloud native space, and many engineers are confused about how a cloud native API gateway relates to Kubernetes Ingress or a Service load balancer.Join this session to learn about:- The evolution of API gateways over the past ten years, and how the original problems they were solving have shifted in relation to cloud native technologies and workflow- Current challenges of using an API gateway within Kubernetes: scaling the developer workflow; and supporting multiple architecture styles and protocols- Strategies for exposing Kubernetes services and APIs at the edge of your system- A brief guide to the (potential) future of cloud native API gateways\n",

One of the earliest challenges to answer when developing for a Kubernetes evnironment was how to enable observability (monitoring, logging and tracing) as well as configuration management for cloud native applications that need to interact with a multitude of management and visualization systems, some of which were created for the cloud (e.g. ONAP), and some which has long been established in telecom service providers' environments.To answer the challenge Ericsson has built a platform using open source projects straight from the CNCF Landscape. This session will show the motivations behind this undertaking, walk you throuh the architecture of the platform and discuss the benefits and challenges of using open source and cloud native for 5G networks.\n",

Additionally, everyone sitting on this panel has access and privilege that must be acknowledged, so we will also dive into what they are doing personally, with this access, to effect positive change within their sphere of influence and how others can do the same.Panelists will engage in an honest discussion framed by the following questions:Discuss your career journey, how did you get where you are?Where do you think you got help in getting where you are?What personal steps are you taking to ensure open source, and particularly Kubernetes, is a community that has opportunities for a broader audience (read: those outside of dominant culture)?What’s one key piece of information you want the audience to take away from this talk?\n",

      "description": "\n  The Kubernetes scheduler does an excellent job scheduling cloud native workloads but the same isn’t true for performance sensitive workloads. Scheduling based on Topology of hardware resources is currently impossible due to the scheduler’s lack of knowledge of node topology. Resulting performance is less predictable, and advanced scheduling strategies – such as trait based placement– are blocked. Topology Manager in kubelet aligns topology-based resource allocations from CPU and Device Manager but only after workloads are scheduled. With Observability tools becoming popular we solve this problem using Prometheus and custom scheduling enhancements. The focus of this talk is Topology Aware Scheduling and we discuss how exposing cluster level topology to the scheduler, and using Prometheus to track NUMA topology related metrics, enhances the default scheduler, empowering it to proactively use node level topology to make intelligent NUMA aware placement decisions leading to more effective cluster wide performance of workloads.\n",

The histogram representation as we know it from Prometheus andnow also OpenMetrics is a simple yet powerful and enables many important use cases. However, it is also infuriatingly limited, mostly because of its high per-bucket cost. Björn “Beorn” Rabenstein released the above mentioned Prometheus version in February 2015 and has been dreaming about better histograms ever since. In this talk, he will explain why it is so hard for Prometheus to adopt established techniques known from various academic publications and even practical applications in other metrics-processing systems. To add a silver lining, he will share his latest findings from reignited efforts to finally break through the barriers and bring efficient high-resolution histograms to Prometheus.\n",

      "description": "\n  We all know that the cloud is a great place to run cloud native applications, but that’s really just the beginning of the story.  Cloud native is as much about how we deliver applications as it is about where we run them, whether that’s in the datacenter, in the cloud, or at the edge.  In fact, edge computing is one area where cloud native technologies can be, and are being, especially well applied.In this talk I will highlight some exciting work being done in CNCF community projects to adapt cloud native technologies for edge use cases, including how they connect edge and cloud to enable edge computing solutions. With these advancements we can employ cloud native technologies to work in ways that are not merely cloud agnostic, but are also edge agnostic.\n",

      "description": "\n  As Kubernetes use-cases continue to proliferate across datacenter, cloud, and edge environments, cluser sprawl is rapidly becoming a real challenge. The root of the challenge is all about management, at scale, in a world where compute is literally everywhere. For most organizations, managing 100s, 1,000s, potentially even millions of clusters is not a question of if, but how soon! In this keynote, we'll discuss the challenges of security, heterogeneous architectures, and connectivity that must be overcome when managing clusters at massive scale, and we'll also highlight several exciting open source initiatives underway to address these challenges.\n",

In addition to your actual source code, container images and Helm Charts and Kubernetes Object YAMLs are all part of bringing apps into production. They are your intellectual property and must be managed carefully.The OCI distribution spec under the Linux Foundation was originally designed for container images, but the manifest and index definitions in the spec are quite flexible. This means it’s possible to support newer artifact types using the OCI distribution spec, including Helm Charts, build caches, snapshots and other YAML files, with some minor modifications, leveraging the same OCI-compliant registries to support more than just containers.In this talk, Ryan Abrams will discuss the common traits of different configuration formats and how you can use existing tools to support them.\n",

Based on CVSS, it categorizes risks associated with each runtime setting while considering how settings affect one another, and offers a global risk score for each workload—not just for individual settings. Attendees will learn how the KCCSS works, how it’s being used by end users for DevSecOps, and best practices for bullet proofing their own K8s applications.\n",

Some application errors (resource leaks and race conditions in particular) can take a long time to reproduce; other errors might occur unexpectedly in production. When this happens, we want to gather as muchinformation as possible without restarting the pod. Tools like detailed logging, debug sidecars, and Linkerd's \"tap\" are only usable if we had the foresight to include them before the error occurred. Ephemeral containers promise to be a useful tool, but are currently in alpha. We will compare these techniques and then see how we can use direct access to the node to enter a pod's network namespace and do detailed network debugging without needing to restart any running containers.\n",

To allow AI and non-AI workloads to securely access HDFS, a scalable, secure, open-source integration with HDFS Kerberos called Kube2Hadoop was built. This enables AI modelers at LinkedIn to use data securely in their model exploration and training with KubeFlow components such as the mpi-operator.

      "description": "\n  Kubernetes provides several types of automation controllers to deploy and manage applications at scale. Each exposes features that provide for zero downtime upgrades and rollbacks but not all controllers are created equal. Deployments provide the widest application compatibility but work best with stateless applications; the aptly named StatefulSet controller provides guarantees that benefit stateful applications, but how do the features of these controllers behave in practice?Learn about these and other Kubernetes controller types through a series of demonstrations that will reveal their features, benefits, and drawbacks. The session will also explore the primitives that enable granular control over rollouts so that you can choose the settings that work best for your application.\n",

That’s because we write migrations the hard way, instead of simply declaring the desired state of the database. Kubernetes has proved that declarative desired state is a great idea, so why not build on top of the Kubernetes API to let the computers figure out how to write database migrations?SchemaHero is an open source Kubernetes CRD/Operator that solves database migrations. Want to add an index, or rename a column? Just kubectl apply the desired definition of a table, and the operator will take over by writing and deploying a migration.Once you stop trying to control the database and just declare the desired state, database migrations are no longer toil, but become predictable and reliable.

Do you know what destination NAT’ing is, and at which step and how it happens (via iptables or IPVS)  for bridged and non-bridged CNI plugins? What about existing network policies and routes on your hardware - are there iptables rules conflicting with the rules added by kube-proxy?\n",
